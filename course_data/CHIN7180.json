The research should both reflect students' factual knowledge of translation/interpreting and demonstrate a sound understanding of theories. Since translation/interpreting is an interdisciplinary subject, research from different disciplinary angles is encouraged. Students are required to write a thesis of 10,000 words, which should demonstrate reasonable theoretical depth. Through this course, students' research ability will be developed or further enhanced, which will prepare them for further research in the future study towards a higher degree.",
