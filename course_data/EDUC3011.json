    "description": "This course will equip students to be able to use social theory to analyse and critique global youth cultures and the connection of these to sport, exercise and movement cultures. Students will investigate how youth are 'positioned' socially, politically and economically, and how these play out in terms of engagement in sport, exercise and diverse movement cultures. Finally the course will consider the idea of 'youth voice' and how this might be mobilised to enhance movement, sport and exercise experiences in a world of diversity.",
