    "description": "Students will develop an understanding of how land use relates to the water cycle with case studies on agricultural systems and principles of sustainable management from farm to catchment scales. They will be able to converse with agriculturalists as informed water managers. Principles of efficient irrigation water use and conservation of water in dryland systems will be emphasised. The intensification of land use has led to the degradation of ecosystems, so this unit will introduce students to remediation techniques to counter land and water degradation through improved management practice. Peri-urban encroachment on agricultural land use and alternative water sources will be examined. An understanding of agricultural water management and approaches off-site mitigation will support the preparation of students for problem-based learning (PBL) exercises such as catchment management. With a focus on peer learning processes, students will enhance their skills in nexus thinking, interrelating different sectors or interests around water uses, methods of integrating and articulating global and local approaches with a broader vision of the larger scales and interactions, and new, multi-disciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to existing and future problems. Flexible delivery involves a one week intensive in Perth, Western Australia, including field trips to the Gnangara mound and southwest WA.\nThis course is offered externally during Summer semester.",
