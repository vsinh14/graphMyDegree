It will enable students to appraise welfare in animal industries, in particular farms, as well as in companion and wild animal settings. It will introduce them to the key roles of behavioural and physiological analysis in welfare assessment and will expose them to hypothetical situations in which they will be required to make judgements on animal management.",
