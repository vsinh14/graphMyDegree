    "description": "This course was previously offered as the Level 2 POLS2115. Please note: the course Levels are not interchangeable - if the course is completed as a Level 2 it cannot be credited as a Level 3.\nThis course explores contemporary challenges in environmental politics and policy, and probes responses to these, using a range of methods and approaches. We will work collaboratively on developing in-depth analyses of prominent contemporary concerns, from climate change through biodiversity issues to contestations over extractive industries, and questions of sustainable development. The course will be run in the format of weekly two-hour workshops, comprising short introductory `mini-lectures\u00c2\u00bf (15-20 minutes), in-class research sessions, task-based group work, and plenary conclusions. Our focus is on combining advanced learning about cutting-edge theories and methods in political analysis with producing substantive analyses of policy and political problems and challenges based on extensively researched case-examples. The latter will cover local, national, international, and transnational instances.\nPlease note that this course, due to its adopted format, will not have lectures recorded and requires a commitment to attending weekly classes.",
