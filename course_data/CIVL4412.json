    "description": "The course provides students with novel knowledge about modelling transport in general, and modelling travel behaviour in particular. The course provides theoretical understanding of behavioural theories underpinning different statistical and econometric model (e.g., regression models, discrete choice models, count data models), as well as their practical application to datasets provided in lab exercises.",
