    "description": "This course introduces students to the different types of information that managers and other decision-makers gather, and the tools used to analyse that information for effective business decisions. It provides an overview of the extensive range of strategic and operational frameworks drawn from fields such as strategic management, financial management, marketing, human resource management, supply chain management and international business. The purpose of this comprehensive toolkit course is not only to provide students with a wide range of the necessary business analytical tools, but also to integrate these tools into a more complete and meaningful package that can be used as a portable toolkit for ensuing courses, and across their post-study career. To do this, this course follows a problem based approach, where an understanding of the decision-making frameworks is gained through its application to practical problems. Three themes per semester will be investigated in groups, using the multiple lenses that tools such as Business Model Canvas, Balanced Scorecards, Career Mapping, SOAR, PESTEL, Market Analysis, Porter's Five Forces, Financial Forecasting, Bell-Mason Diagnostic, Prior Art Searches, Scenario Planning, Technology Analysis, SWOT, Strategy Diamond, Seven Tools of Project Management, Business Plans, Root Cause Analysis, MInto Pyramid, and HR Audits provide. This will provide students with insights into both the nature of the business problems as well as methods that are used for identifying and evaluating alternative solutions.",
