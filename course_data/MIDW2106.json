    "description": "This course will continue to extend students' midwifery practice. Building on the skills developed in MIDW2103, students will extend their practice to include care of women and families experiencing life-threatening complications around labour and birth. The role of the midwife in the multidisciplinary healthcare team responding to unexpected life-threatening emergencies will be analysed, and simulated experiences will be further utilised to assist students to extend their practice. Care of women in premature labour and birth and subsequent care of the premature neonate will also be covered. Students will be assessed for clinical competence and continue to maintain a portfolio of evidence in the acquisition of these skill based competencies. In the clinical practice aspect of this course it is recommended that students conduct 5 births in the role of primary accoucher. It is a requirement of this course that at least 4 continuity of care experiences (CoCe) are in the process of being completed this semester for BMid students, and 1-3 for BN/BMid students. Please note that birthing numbers may include women that the student has engaged with as part of the CoCe.",
