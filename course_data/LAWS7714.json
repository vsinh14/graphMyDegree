    "description": "This course critically examines international and regional laws (treaties and case-law), and domestic policies and laws (legislation and case-law) and politics, relating to forced migration. Study will focus on both historical and contemporary refugee law and practice in Australia in light of international refugee law, and international human rights law in particular. The transplantation of those international norms into domestic law via the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (and key cases interpreting and applying those laws) will be carefully and critically analysed. Attention will also focus on the key challenges to refugee protection raised by contemporary Australian practices, especially in respect of asylum seekers arriving irregularly by sea; including mandatory detention, offshore (regional) processing and temporary protection. The course will encourage students to incorporate comparative and/or interdisciplinary perspectives into their legal analyses of international law and domestic law and practice.",
