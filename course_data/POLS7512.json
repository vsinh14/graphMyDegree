    "description": "Peace and conflict resolution analysts and practitioners confront complex and challenging questions of authority and legitimacy. Existing forms of social and political order authorise ways of responding to conflict that can assist peace-processes and conflict resolution or, alternatively, incite and perpetuate conflicts. To develop capacities for navigating these complexities, this course critically and intensively investigates a selection of core concepts including (but not limited to) power, interests, and sovereignty. Concepts are examined in relation to case studies to reflect upon how to constructively support effective peace and conflict resolution efforts.",
