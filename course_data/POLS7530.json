It will focus on its conceptual and theoretical development since the publication of the R2P report by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) in 2001, the challenges it presents to traditional conception of state sovereignty, and the issues and problems that emerged in its implementation or application in responding to four mass atrocity crimes\u00c2\u00bfgenocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity\u00c2\u00bfin various parts of the world (e.g., Africa, Asia Pacific). It will also cover topics related to R2P and state violence, gender and sexual violence, humanitarian crisis, and policy-relevant mechanisms and approaches to mass atrocity crime prevention",
