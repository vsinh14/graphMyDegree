    "description": "What are the main results that executives/stakeholders want to know when it comes to Quality and Performance? Why do so many advertised leadership positions require applicants to speak knowledgeably on Quality and Performance? How do Quality & Performance issues differ substantially from Quality & Safety Issues? This course provides important knowledge on these foundational concepts in Healthcare Services project management. Using the `Continuous Quality Improvement\u00c2\u00bf framework, this course shows you why Quality and Performance is not as straightforward as you think and how to use your knowledge to your advantage. You will learn to discuss with confidence the ideas of key thinkers in health on Quality and Performance, how to implement a Plan-Do-Study- Act (PDSA) cycle to improve service delivery in your organisation, and how to measure patient safety and clinical performance in reliable ways. You will engage with key ideas in appropriate management strategy, choose tools for measurement, and articulate the results to other individuals, team members and the organisation. By the time you finish this course, you will be able to display, with confidence, advanced knowledge on management theories and practices in Quality and Performance in Healthcare Services.",
