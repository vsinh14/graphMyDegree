    "description": "Animal remains are a powerful means for understanding past climate and environmental change, anthropogenic impacts and shifts in human behaviour. This course integrates technical aspects of faunal studies with theoretical and methodological issues in archaeology, including questions of faunal assemblage formation (taphonomy), human economics and ecology, the relationship between game use and technology, and the anthropology of human-animal relationships. Class work emphasises hands-on experience with faunal remains and will teach students how to identify animal (skeletal) remains from archaeological sites. A final research project will include the identification and analysis of zooarchaeological assemblage. This course may not be run if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.",
