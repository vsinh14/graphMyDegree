    "description": "This course uses electromagnetic principles to present the theory & operation of simple circuit devices & antennas at microwave frequencies, which are the part of modern microwave communication equipment. The emphasis is placed on planar guiding & radiating structures that enable either hybrid &/or monolithic integration of the devices. Modern CAD software packages are introduced & demonstrated through simulations of microwave networks & antenna configurations.",
