    "description": "Students will learn of later life physical and psychological development and healthy ageing. Knowledge of the major health and social issues associated with ageing will be explored in relation to how nursing management is affected. Students will learn about homeostasis, optimising defences against infection and issues associated with antibiotic use using practice problems. Using practice problems involving elderly people with multiple health problems, the course will cover social and health care delivery implications when caring for ageing populations in Australia. Students will explore: nursing care; the rights of the older person; the ethical and legal issues relating to the non-competent adult; as well as the range of care provided for the elderly in all care settings, including informal care in the family. Strategies to minimise impact on the health of carers, the prevalence and risk factors for ageing related health problems and strategies to prevent these problems will also be explored.",
