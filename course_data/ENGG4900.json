You will be able to identify barriers to technology uptake and work towards overcoming these through practical knowledge of: engineering economics, engineering law, engineering ethics, and the nature of engineering businesses. Students will learn how to undertake and interpret cost-benefit analyses, develop the skills required to understand business decision-making and economic drivers relevant to engineering and investigate key concepts required for ethical professional practice.\nIndustry representatives and academics will deliver key note lectures. Students will engage in workshops and project-based discipline-specific content and assessment which will lead the student through the issues encountered in professional engineering practice. Assessment will have both written and oral sections.",
