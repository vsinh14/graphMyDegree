    "description": "This course examines the economic and political aspects of globalisation. It introduces students to a range of theoretical perspectives on international political economy, globalisation and development. Globalisation is conceived of as both a distinct phenomenon in its own right and as an influence on domestic and trans-national relations. Specific issues include consideration of the evolving international economic system and the new governance structures that seek to shape it, and the way such processes have influenced development outcomes.",
