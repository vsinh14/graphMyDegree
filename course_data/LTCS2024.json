In using examples from a variety of cultural texts, students will gain a sense of the way in which different kinds of societies emerge out of distinct historical processes. Students will learn to adopt critical strategies to analyse texts in a directed manner by examining how Francophone identities are mediated through cultural production.\nNote: Course offering may be cancelled unless a minimum of 20 students enrol.",
