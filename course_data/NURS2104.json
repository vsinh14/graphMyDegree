    "description": "The aim of the course is to introduce students to caring for children in partnership with their families. The course will encompass health care concepts relevant to newborns and children through to adolescents. Course content will span physiological changes across childhood, milestone development, health promotion strategies, public health screening, illness and injury prevention and acute care through to chronic illness in children. Social concepts and theories of family will also be explored. \n\nThe course will examine concepts related to delivering safe child and family centred care in both acute care environments and in the community including the home. The National Health priority Areas will guide the course structure. The course is interwoven with Clinical Practice 4 to build on evidence-based practice approaches to delivering care to children and their families with acute and chronic health needs. There is an expectation that students continue to reflect on how their practice meets the NMBA Registered Nurse Standards for Practice. This course is a companion course for NURS2106 Clinical Practice 4.",
