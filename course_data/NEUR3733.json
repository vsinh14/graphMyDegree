    "description": "Students will be introduced to advanced concepts in biomechanics and motor control (neuromechanics). Issues concerning i) muscle, tendon and muscle architecture, ii) motion analysis, iii) reflex pathways and excitability, iv) postural control and v) neural plasticity and motor learning will be covered in three modules. Lectures, demonstrations, laboratory sessions and prescribed readings will be used to facilitate learning within the course.",
