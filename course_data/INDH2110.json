    "description": "The course is designed to provide an introduction to theoretical approaches, analytical and practical skills in social science and in particular, to an understanding of health problems facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The course includes an overview of social science theory as applied in public health and appropriate approaches to investigating and analysing causes and aspects of health inequality. The significance of social and cultural factors in the design and delivery of health services will also be presented, highlighting the use of appropriate methods when answering social research questions and recognising and avoiding ethnocentric bias when considering the social and cultural contexts of health issues. The course will also explore ways of evaluating the relative advantages of qualititative and quantitative approaches in action research and rapid assessment situations.",
