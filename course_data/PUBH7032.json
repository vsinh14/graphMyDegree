    "description": "The environment plays an all-important role in the health of children. Children respond very differently to adults following exposures to environmental hazards like air and water pollution. Healthy environments protect children's health, and the ultimate goal of CEH is to ensure that children's environments are as healthy as possible. This course will help students develop an understanding of how environmental exposures affect children's health, while considering the complex interactions between the unique biological and psycho-social characteristics of children, and the diverse socio-economic settings they grow up in.",
