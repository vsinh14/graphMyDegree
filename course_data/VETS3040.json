    "description": "This course outlines the various agents and initiators of disease in animals and how they respond at the organismal, tissue, cellular and molecular levels. It describes pathological processes associated with infectious and/or toxic insults, as well as homeostatic imbalances (e.g. metabolic or nutritional diseases) and other general forms of pathology, e.g. neoplasia, inflammation. Students will develop skills in microscopic and gross inspection of animals and their tissues to describe and classify types of disease. Immunological and other host mechanisms for disease resistance and response will also be discussed.",
