    "units": "4",
    "duration": "One Semester",
    "description": "Students in this course design architecture that is shaped by landscape and in turn, shapes landscapes. The idealisation of wilderness, agrarian and (post) industrial landscapes through historical concepts such as the picturesque, as well as contemporary ideas about nature as a casualty of human activity, are the conceptual backdrop for interrogating the relationship between buildings and their environments. Design research in this course includes extensive fieldwork that may include the use of GIS and unmanned aerial vehicles, documentation of natural processes and systems, and reference to other genres in which landscapes and nature are portrayed. Students explore active and temporal relationships between architecture and its environment and develop proposals that engage a wide range of scales.",
