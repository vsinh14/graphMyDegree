    "description": "Achieving corporate sustainability is a challenge that increasingly occupies the attention of senior executives and key stakeholders of twenty-first century organisations. The path forward is protracted, noisy and tough, but provides opportunities for those corporations that see value inherent in the emerging ethos of sustainability. This ethos is already apparent in increasing pressures on corporations from governments, shareholders and political interest groups to change wasteful and destructive practices. This course focuses on how organisations can develop effective value-creating strategies in relation to sustainability. Topics include an introduction to the science behind sustainability, a closer examination of the moral, legal and business case behind action on sustainability, as well as the development, assessment and implementation of strategies to create sustainable value. The course discusses different change strategies - incremental and transformational - required to shift organisations towards sustainability, as well as the role played by senior executives, managers and other stakeholders as change agents for sustainability.",
