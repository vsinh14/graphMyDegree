With its origin some 4.5 billion years ago, ERTH1000 will examine Earth's evolution, from both a geological and biological perspective. The course will explore concepts as diverse as the origin of the Solar System through to the evolution of life. It will touch on the big geological processes that have shaped our planet, covering topics including plate tectonics, volcanology, earthquakes and climate change. ERTH1000 is recommended for all students in geology, ecology, biology, marine, environmental science and archaeology, and is also appropriate for anyone who wants to know more about the world they live on.
