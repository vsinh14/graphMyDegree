    "description": "This course builds on the knowledge, skills and understanding developed and consolidated during Dental Practice III A and III B through the provision of comprehensive care for adult patients with increasingly complex needs. While maintaining competencies previously achieved, students will acquire and consolidate new skills in assessment, recognition and diagnosis of dental and oral conditions, comprehensive oral care planning including referrals, preventive oral health care, periodontal care, intra-coronal restorations and dental analgesia for patients with moderately complex general dental needs. Each week students will undertake 6 hours of direct patient care and 6 hours of competency building activities such as lectures, case-based discussions and workshops. This course assumes approximately 3 hours of self-directed learning each week.",
