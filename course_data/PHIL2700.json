    "description": "This course is a practical approach to philosophy & education by drawing on philosophical methods of inquiry to address questions regarding education, as both formal educational provisions and teaching practices, and as learning which comes from social experience. It explores historical and contemporary approaches to education, the relation between philosophy, teaching and learning, and social and political issues. Issues addressed include: epistemology, pedagogy and curriculum; philosophy as a method of education; moral dimensions of education; education and citizenship; feminist approaches to education; and interculturality and Indigenous education, and moral development. The course also analyses the purpose, process, nature and ideals of education and the kinds of educational arrangements required to support democratic ways of life. Using as a starting point the idea of philosophical inquiry as an educational process, the approach will be multi-disciplinary.",
