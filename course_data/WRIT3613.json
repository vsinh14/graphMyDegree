    "description": "This capstone course is designed to give third year history students a thorough grounding in researching, writing and presenting a finished historical 'product' for a specified audience. The audience may be viewers of an exhibition created by a library or museum, readers of a popular magazine, users of a historical website, or school students. Close attention is paid to the quality of written expression and the ability of students to prepare visually engaging materials for a broad audience of readers/viewers. The final product can be presented to a potential employer as an example of the student's ability as a professional historian.",
