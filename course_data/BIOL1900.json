    "description": "Biophysical Development, Measurement and Assessment (BIOL1900) is an introductory course that aims to provide understanding and analysis of how humans grow and develop with a focus on exercise, health and sport. In particular, four main sub-disciplines of human movement will be examined: anatomy, exercise physiology, psychology and motor learning. In conjunction with learning the basic knowledge in lectures, throughout the course students will also measure and then assess their own biophysical data from these four areas in laboratory classes. As such, this course will allow students to develop their theoretical understanding of growth and development in exercise, sport and health while also allowing opportunities to develop practical skills.",
