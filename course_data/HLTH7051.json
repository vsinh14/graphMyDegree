    "description": "As clinicians, our early development and perspectives focus on the extremely important and complex minutia of clinical care. We see the whole healthcare system through a series of narrow lenses which relate to the immediate clinical problem and our ability to navigate with our patients through complex and frequently frustrating processes over which we have limited control. \n\nThe architecture, policies, funding and service delivery design of the whole healthcare system impacts us and our patients at almost every moment of the working day. \n\nThis course is designed to provide a \u00c2\u00bfhelicopter\u00c2\u00bf view of the current healthcare system \u00c2\u00bf who does it serve? Who funds and delivers care? How is the workforce trained and distributed? How does this all affect the consumers of healthcare at the point of care?",
