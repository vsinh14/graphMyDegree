    "description": "Sport is a significant activity, in and of itself, but its real potential is as a gateway to understanding how social and cultural determinants - such as age, ability, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and race - operate in our society to impact knowledge and experiences of physical activity and health. This course prepares students for transition into the workplace by providing the groundwork to understand the complexity of Australian society. Understanding this complexity will enable aspiring professionals to work with clients from different socio-economic backgrounds, sexualities, racial and ethnic communities, and with those who have physical and mental disabilities. This course will generate social and cultural sensitivities to ensure that undergraduates will be optimally prepared to function as capable and competent graduates in a wide range of sport and health vocations through their understanding of society and culture.",
