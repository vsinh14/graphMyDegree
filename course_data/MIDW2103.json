The midwife's role in obstetric emergencies will be considered and simulated experiences will be utilised to assist student in the development of emergency response skills. Students will be assessed for clinical competence and maintain a portfolio of evidence in the acquisition of skill based competencies. In the clinical practice aspect of this course students will be required to conduct 5 births in the role of primary accoucheur. It is a requirement that at least 4 continuity of care experiences (CoCe) are in the process of being completed this semester.
