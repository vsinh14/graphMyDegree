    "description": "This course continues to develop the basic clinical skills taught in MEDI7121 and MEDI7122. Further development of skills is facilitated by exposure to real patients both under supervision and in the students' own time. The course comprises several components focusing on complementary skills - Clinical Coaching, Clinical Communication Skills, Procedural Skills Workshops and Master Classes. \n\nClinical Coaching sessions assist students to advance from peer examination in MEDI7121 and MEDI7122, to traditional bedside tutorials with clinicians using real patient histories and examination findings as the basis for learning. This form of learning enables the students to progress their skills, so that they are competently performing both systemic and focused histories, both systemic and focused physical examinations and developing the complex clinical reasoning skills necessary to progress into Year 3. \n\nClinical Communication Skills tutorials are dedicated skills development sessions based on difficult and challenging communication scenarios faced by medical professionals on a regular basis. \n\nProcedural Skills Workshops are designed to teach students common and basic procedural skills necessary for working as a junior doctor. \n\nMaster Classes are teaching sessions dedicated to a variety of specialty areas including Women's and Men's Health, Clinical Ophthalmology, Endocrine Examination and Suturing.",
