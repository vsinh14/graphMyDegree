    "description": "Many modern applications of mathematics are carried out on personal computers or super-computers. This course will introduce students to the theory and advanced applications of scientific computing using Matlab. The first section of the course will focus on numerical integration, solution of ordinary \ndifferential equations, solving large systems of equations and optimization. In the second half, finite-difference and finite-element methods will be introduced for boundary value problems and partial differential equations.",
