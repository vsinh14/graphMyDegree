    "description": "This course explores the diversity of microorganisms, their cellular biology, growth & nutrition, metabolism, & basic genetics. The role of microorganism in disease, as well as their ecology & applications in biotechnology is also examined. Students will gain an insight into the immune response to infection by studying the innate, humoral & cellular immune systems & their functions in health & disease. The practical component of the course will include laboratory experiments to demonstrate principles learned in the lectures, where students will gain practical skills in safely handling microbial cultures for isolation & identification. The course provides the fundamental knowledge & skills needed to proceed further in microbiology, but also for all courses or disciplines involving molecular biology & biotechnology.",
