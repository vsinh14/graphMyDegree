These two placement blocks will provide an opportunity to apply the professional practice concepts and foundational nursing knowledge and skills that you have been learning to ensure safe practice. The observational practice block will enable you to experience first-hand the role of the registered nurse working within an interdisciplinary healthcare team. During the immersive practice block you will develop skills in individualising nursing care for older adults in community, residential aged care or acute clinical settings. Students will apply a person-centred and evidence informed approach to interventions including clinical assessment, assistance with activities of daily living, and therapeutic and professional communication.",
