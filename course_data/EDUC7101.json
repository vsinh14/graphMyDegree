    "description": "Organisations (including schools) everywhere today are experiencing ongoing and discontinuous change. Despite the ubiquitous nature of change - reforms, restructurings, innovations - many are not implemented as originally conceived. This course examines the drivers of many of the changes in education today, identifies facilitators and barriers to successful change, and seeks to help students better understand some of the complexities of change processes in organisations today.\n\nThis course may not be offered internally if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
