    "description": "Since our first appearance humans have depended on plants, whether used for food, fuel, fodder for animals or used in building and crafts. Archaeobotany - the study of past human plant use through analysis of the plant remains found in archaeological sites -provides a direct means of charting the long term history of plant use. This course introduces the subject of archaeobotany, including its method and how the subject informs key archaeological debates, including an understanding of foraging practice, farming history, trade networks, fuel selection strategies, landscape management, ecosystem degradation and human responses to environmental change. Students will take part in weekly laboratory practical classes to learn the key skills of archaeobotany, including microscopy, quantification and data analysis.",
