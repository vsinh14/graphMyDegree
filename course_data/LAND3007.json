    "description": "Any economic development rural, urban or industrial transforms or impacts on our land. Subsequent changes to our land can only be predicted and assessed, benefits maximised and potential damages minimised if the factors that control or influence land use options are understood. The course covers physical, biological, social and economic factors that determine land use, capability, and how these different factors are connected and affect land use decisions. An important aspect of this course is the examination of environmental, economic and social consequences of the use of land for agriculture and other purposes.",
