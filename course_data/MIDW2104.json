Building on the concepts learned in the Semester 1 mental health course students will further explore the impact of maternal mental wellness and illness and learn to identify the normal adjustment reactions to motherhood and distinguish them from the early warning signs of emotional distress or mental illness in the postpartum period. Students will learn about issues that impact on the mental health of women and how the midwife can provide appropriate support and care to keep women and babies safe.",
