    "description": "To remain an important entity in decision-making processes related to sustainable resource use, it is essential to stimulate engagement between conservation professionals and leading industry entities representing competing land use objectives with implications for conservation. While spending seven days at a field research station on North Stradbroke Island, providing for an \u00c2\u00bfoutside classroom\u00c2\u00bf experience, you will be exposed to a variety of real-life conservation challenges and solutions including industry, tourism, conservation and local community involvement. While exposed to these challenges, you will be engaged with the collection of primary field data that are considered essential for the regional mining industry because it facilitates transparency for development. Once back in the classroom, the field data will be used in the second half of this course to learn and explore ways on how to apply Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques to analyse biological data and address research questions relevant to the field of conservation biology.",
