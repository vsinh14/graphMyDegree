    "description": "This course examines the evolution of international relations from 1900 to the present, and is intended to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the key developments that have shaped world politics and the discipline of international relations. This course is particularly targeted at students of international relations (IR), and provide those students with knowledge about the evolution of IR as a discipline, a sense of the relationship between IR theory and the major dynamics/ events of world politics, and provide context to the examination of contemporary world politics. Each week of the course, therefore, attempts to link key developments in world politics to the emergence/dominance of particular frameworks for thinking about international relations.",
