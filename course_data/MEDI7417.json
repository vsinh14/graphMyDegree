    "description": "*Year-long course commencing semester 1*\nThe year-long Y4 Workplace Learning Portfolio course is designed to support development of clinical competence in the clinical environment. It draws on workplace-based assessments (WBAs) completed during all Year 4 courses that involve clinical placements. The WBAs comprise assessment across eight components of clinical practice: history and physical examination, clinical reasoning, clinical management and procedural skills, clinical communication, professional practice, medical ethics and law, social/cultural competence and safety, and reflective practice. These are aggregated in the UQ ePortfolio system to enable students to monitor longitudinal clinical development and proactively manage their learning in response to feedback. A formative mid-year review of the Workplace Learning Portfolio will assist staff and students in identifying any areas for future improvement, and the strategies required to achieve it.",
