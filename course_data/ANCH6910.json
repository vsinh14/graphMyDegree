    "description": "Family life in the ancient world was just as varied and at times problematic as it is in the modern world. For example, divorce and remarriage, concern for children, education and preparation for adult life, and the maintenance and transmission of property were all issues that concerned populations of the ancient Mediterranean. This course will analyse the nature and structure of the family and household in the ancient world, placing particular emphasis on the Roman familia and domus during the late Republican and Imperial periods. It will examine how public and private issues relating to family and property affected people of different social and cultural backgrounds.",
