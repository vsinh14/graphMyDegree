    "description": "This course teaches intermediate and advanced geological field mapping skills. It will be held in Mt Isa and will include a number of exercises in geological mapping. The first part of the course will involve mapping well-stratified, folded and faulted low greenschist facies rocks south of Lake Moondara. This will be followed by a 2day excercise in digital mapping. In the 2nd wee, students will map in the area of Mica Creek. where the rocks are more strongly deformed and metamorphosed. Mapping will concentrate on multiple fabric elements and relationships between several meta-igneous bodies.",
