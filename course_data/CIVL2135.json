    "description": "Engineers, professionally and as members of society, encounter environmental issues either directly or by way of regulations and workplace practices. They are also at the forefront of designing and implementing many of the changes needed to manage impacts and lead to sustainable development. This course is an introduction to the more significant environmental issues and associated sustainability challenges with a focus on implications for engineers in practice. Topics include: population & urbanisation issues, climate change; waste management, biodiversity; air, water & noise pollution and principles of sustainable and water sensitive urban design. Through these topics students are introduced to the monitoring & assessment of environmental data; and project-based investigation of issues is used to encourage deeper exploration of several topics.",
