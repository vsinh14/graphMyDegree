    "description": "In this unit, students will learn advanced water engineering knowledge developed based on the recent research work, and apply it for water sensitive urban design (WSUD) through integrated urban water management (IUWM) approach. It will `open\u00c2\u00bf the modern city\u00c2\u00bfs `black box\u00c2\u00bf and reveal the water and pollutant flows and inventories, as well as the interactions between different parts of the water cycle. Another focus of this course is to provide an overview of urban water system in various scenarios, including centralised, decentralised and hybrid system design in greenfield and existing developments in different regions and countries. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to use IUWM approach for WSUD covering primarily engineering design aspects, and use their knowledge to contribute to the planning guidelines, policies and regulations. Group and individual projects and assignments during the course will also enhance students' communication, presentation and teamwork skills.",
