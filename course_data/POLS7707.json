    "description": "Based on the theory of problem-based learning (PBL), this course will introduce students to a development context and challenge. Students will work independently under the instruction and supervision of an academic staff member to research and analyse this context, leading to the proposal of a development assistance program. The semester involves the student working independently on their Project, with regular contact between students and their supervisor, and the preparation of an 8,000 -10,000 word report. The Final Project allows students to combine and consolidate their learning from the overall Program and to address a cutting-edge real-world development challenge. This results in self-directed, deep learning and the development of advanced research and problem solving skills.",
