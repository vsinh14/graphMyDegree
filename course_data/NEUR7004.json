    "description": "Not offered 2011\nThis course will use a systems approach to explore the brain with respect to circuits (both sensory and motor) that integrate and process information. Sensory systems such as vision, hearing and taste and the pathways responsible for detecting temperature, pain and the level of muscular contraction will all be examined in the context of synaptic transmission, filtering and feedback mechanisms. Motor systems initiating and controlling movement, pattern generation, timing and muscular force will be investigated in the context of balance, posture, co-ordination, strength and fatigue. Sensory-motor integration will also be investigated with respect to interactions with other cognitive tasks through the mirror neurone system, plasticity (during development/growth and in old age) and in abnormal conditions such as disease or after a lesion.",
