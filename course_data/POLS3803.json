    "description": "This capstone course addresses foundational political questions such as: how should we organize our societies? What is justice? Whose responsibility is it to create a just society? What is the state and what power should it have in our lives? How do we understand and perform political identities around citizenship, subjecthood, gender and race? Students will engage with these ideas through contemporary examples and through their own reading of landmark texts.",
