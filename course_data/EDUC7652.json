    "description": "The course prepares pre-service teachers to teach intermediate and advanced level Mathematics in the senior phase of schooling. This course provides opportunities for pre-service teachers who are qualified to undertake two mathematics teaching areas to build on the knowledge and skills developed in EDUC7644 Mathematics: Curriculum Studies. The course will engage pre-service teachers in an extended analysis of recent disciplinary developments in scholarship and professional practice in the teaching of Mathematics. They will be provided with opportunities to develop relevant knowledge and teaching strategies to address literacy and numeracy demands and learning opportunities that exist in intermediate and advanced level Mathematics. A focus of the course will be on interacting with and developing activities and learning experiences which engage and deepen student understanding of mathematics beyond the textbook. Pre-service teachers will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to practice through (i) designing, implementing and evaluating effective learning and teaching sequences and discipline specific assessment tasks that draw on curriculum, assessment, and ICT knowledge; and (ii) identifying and designing discipline specific opportunities for professional engagement and communication within the school context, teaching networks and the broader community. EDUC7644 Mathematics: Curriculum Studies is a co-requisite for this course.",
