    "description": "This course considers the vibrant segment of the trade publishing market that is children's and young adult writing, both from the perspective of the publishing professional and the creative writer. While the conditions of publishing have seen considerable disruptions and reconfigurations since the turn of the 21st century, the children's and young adult market has remained reliably significant in both economic and artistic terms. The course will consider the ways in which writing for children and young adults may differ from writing for other audiences; the particular ways in which these texts are produced, marketed, and circulated; and how authors and publishers relate to younger readers.",
