Students will complete an individual project and produce a 6,000-8,000 word research report over Semester 1 and Semester 2 in Year 4. The research project involves the design, implementation, analysis and interpretation of data and an oral and written presentation of the project. The approach taken is blended learning with a combination of workshops, simulated learning and peer and group supervision to support students to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to complete the project.",
