    "description": "(Offered on an occasional basis.)\nModel-Driven Software Engineering is an approach for the architecture and development of software systems based on describing the different parts of the system using domain-specific models with formalised mappings between them in order to manage their complexity and improve their quality. This course introduces the idea of model-driven engineering, and teaches students how it can be used to develop and reason about systems, including the creation of tools for supporting modelling processes, and the use of model-based approaches for building and reasoning about software systems.",
