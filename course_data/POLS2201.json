    "description": "This course examines contemporary Australian foreign policy. We explore theories of foreign policy in international relations before examining the process of foreign policy formation and the role of history, culture and identity in influencing Australian foreign policy. We then apply these insights to Australian foreign policy in exploring Australia's key relationships (including the US, Asia-Pacific and UN system) and its engagement with key issues in global politics (including security, economics, development and environment).",
