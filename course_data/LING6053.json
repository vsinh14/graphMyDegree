    "description": "An investigation and analysis of a significant contribution to linguistic research within a chosen sub-field, in it empirical, methodological and theoretical context. Texts may be drawn from a variety of approaches and time periods, but must include some contemporary work. The sub-field should be related to, but distinct from, the topic of the proposed Honours thesis. The course will explore appropriate modes of investigation and argumentation within the sub-field and linguistics more generally. The aim is to promote an enhanced understanding of the progress of linguistic scholarship, and develop the critical and analytical skills necessary for the pursuit of independent and original research.",
