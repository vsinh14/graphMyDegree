    "description": "Going beyond commonplace perceptions that equate violence with men and victim-hood with women, this course examines how masculine and feminine roles are constructed and embodied in conflict and peacemaking. We examine the gendered expectations borne by men in conflict, the varied roles women play in the prosecution of conflict, the gendered face of conflict-related violence and the need for greater attention to gender in all efforts to build peace and resolve conflict. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (and later follow-up resolutions), will form an important focal point for deliberation in this course, alongside other historical and contemporary case-studies. Students will gain enhanced gender analysis skills and an understanding of how and why these are pertinent to assessments of conflict, insecurity and peace-building.",
