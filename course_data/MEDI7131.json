    "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts necessary for an understanding of the ethical basis of medical practice, medical professionalism, and the legal framework in which medicine is practised. This understanding develops in an integrated way as students begin to develop their basic clinical and communication skills. Students begin to learn that some aspects of medical practice are the subject of a strong ethical consensus, while others are matters of considerable debate or even deep social division. Students' learning experiences will challenge them to begin to critically appraise the goals of medical practice and their own values. They will also be introduced to the idea that medicine is both an academic enterprise and a social practice, such that success requires the demonstration of basic and applied scientific and clinical knowledge, clinical competence, and satisfactory professional conduct.",
