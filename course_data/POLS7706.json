    "description": "A 16,000 word thesis reporting the findings of a year-long research project drafted in consultation with an academic supervisor. Students commencing in Semester 1 enrol in POLS7705 for two consecutive semesters. Students commencing in Semester 2 enrol in POLS7706 for two consecutive semesters.\n\n\nThis is a restricted entry course and requires prior approval from the School. Prospective students must themselves identify and approach a potential supervisor and discuss their proposed research question; supervisors are not assigned by the School for this course. \nStudent eligibility will be examined in the following areas:\n - Grade point average (GPA): successful applicants would be expected to have achieved a program GPA of 5.5 or better in their Masters program\n - Progression through degree : successful applicants would be expected to be in the final semester of their studies (or have completed at least #8 units in the program) \n- Viability of project : the project outline will be reviewed to determine its quality, viability and feasibility. \n- Availability of supervisor : research projects must be of direct interest to an academic staff member within the school, who in turn must have the workload capacity to supervise a student. Students are required to not only be self-motivated and self-disciplined, but also to determine and develop their own project in consultation with their supervisor.\nFurther information - including the application form and the application due date - is available from the POLSIS website : https://polsis.uq.edu.au/student-support\nStudents are required to submit the application form and their research proposal by the relevant due date by email to polsis@uq.edu.au.",
