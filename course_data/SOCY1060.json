    "description": "This course will introduce students to key concepts and perspectives in sociology through a focus on sexuality and gender. The course covers a wide range of topics such as classical and contemporary theories of gender and sexuality, how gender and sexuality are constructed through sport, and body work (such as tattoo and bodybuilding), how issues such as fat and work/family are gendered, and how gender intersects with other social statuses (including a case study of Aboriginal Australia). Ultimately, the course grapples with the issues surrounding the social construction of gender and sexuality over time and across cultures and place.",
