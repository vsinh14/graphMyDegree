    "description": "Together with its related activities, such as distribution warehousing and transport, service operations is one of the most important industries in this country. Moreover, the efficiency and effectiveness of service operations are key factors in maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage in what has now become a global business environment. Coles-Myer, Aldi, Netto, Ed, McDonald's and Wal-Mart typify the highly complex, international operations that rely on highly sophisticated information systems and multi-channels for their distribution to the ultimate customer. While many international service concepts are interrelated, the course tackles service operations management issues relating to global networks by drawing upon recent case studies, keynote lectures and contemporary service operations management research findings.",
