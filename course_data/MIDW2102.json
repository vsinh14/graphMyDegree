    "description": "This course will provide students with an overview of some of the complexities women have in pregnancy. Some women experience complications and/or have existing medical conditions that will require specialist obstetric and multidisciplinary care during pregnancy, labour and birth and in the postpartum period. Midwives play a pivotal role in the care process not only in delivering the necessary care but also in providing continuity and support and interfacing either directly or indirectly with all members of the multidisciplinary team. The role of the midwife in screening, assessment, and early detection of such conditions, as well as the psychological impact on mothers and families will be explored. Students will have the opportunity to practice skills of monitoring, assessing and caring for the woman and baby with complexities, in a simulated environment.",
