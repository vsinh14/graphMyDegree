    "description": "NOT OFFERED IN 2011.\nThis course is last offered in 2010. It will be discontinued from 2011 onwards.\nMaximum quota of 40 students. Enrolment is open to the first 40 students who enrol in this course on mySI-net.\nThis course provides advanced knowledge and skills in child and family practice for social workers. Social workers practice with children and families in a range of contexts, including family support, child protection, mental health, health, education, and counselling services. Particular attention is placed on practice contexts where there is suspected or substantiated harm to children. In such situations, social workers need to be able to develop working alliances with both parents and children, and at times, alternative caregivers. The skills of sensitive interviewing of children and adult carers, as well as skills in risk assessment and crisis intervention, are a focus of this course. Skills in working with separation and loss issues for children and their families, in culturally appropriate ways, are also an important component of this course.",
