Students are required to utilise the advanced thinking processes that occupational therapy practitioners use when planning and undertaking their work and making professional decisions. It emphasises the importance of both concrete experience and reflection upon that experience in developing competence as an occupational therapist. Students will be required to use description, analysis and reflection in order to facilitate learning and understanding based on their fieldwork experiences.",
