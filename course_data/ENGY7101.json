Students will gain an understanding of the conceptual, policy and legal frameworks shaping this transition at both national and international levels with a particular emphasis on national level tools, strategies and arrangements in Australia and other highly industrialised economies. Students will engage with scholars and practitioners working on post-carbon transition issues in an interactive and group-based learning environment and will acquire the ability to contribute to the design of post-carbon/low-carbon regulatory initiatives.",
