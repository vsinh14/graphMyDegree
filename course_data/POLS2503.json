    "description": "This course explores the philosophical underpinnings and practical application of nonviolence as a means for effecting social change. Making extensive use of case studies and primary sources, we study the relationship between violence and nonviolence in particular historical contexts, as well as examining debates over the ethics and efficacy of resistance. By focusing on nonviolence, as well as its ostensible opposite, we gain insight into the character of social relations and the distinct forms of violence and nonviolence which mark the everyday lived experiences of people across the world. Such insights allow us to think anew about the nature of contemporary conflicts and resistance movements, including, for example, consideration of the role of new technologies and social media in the pursuit of social change.",
