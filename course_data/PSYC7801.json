Students will be introduced to the various foundational counselling skills through direct teaching and demonstrations as well as being given supervised practice in the performance of these skills and their integration into a respectful approach to counselling. A link between skills and theoretical underpinnings is an important part of the course. It encourages the student to consider the balance between the science and the practice of psychology, and the value of interviewing skills in the the process of assessment and case formulation. A satisfactory level of proficiency is expected before students can pass this course.",
