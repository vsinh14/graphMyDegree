    "description": "Aims to give insights into how gender interacts with race and ethnicity in relation to various issues and how this can be read in cultural production across a variety of genres. The course's main focus is on the notions of gender, race/ethnicity, and sexuality, and their various interpretations and associated practices, in a number of cultures around the world. The course discusses the historical development of those notions in Western thought, and their various and successive reinventions by feminist thinkers and queer theoreticians, drawing on the disciplines of women's and gender studies, men's and GLBT studies, race cognisant, and anti-racism approaches and whiteness studies. The course will consider these ideas in transnational frames and contexts.",
