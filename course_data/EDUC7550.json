    "description": "This course is one of two courses within the MTeach (Primary) that focus on the teaching and learning of Literacy and English. Three interrelated aspects of the teaching profession provide a developmental framework for the courses: knowing yourself as a literacy/English teacher; knowing your students; and knowing the disciplinary content of subject English as well as the place of literacy teaching and learning within other curriculum areas. In this course students will develop a repertoire of teaching strategies and practices related to the teaching of English; identify a range of assessment techniques and strategies suitable for diverse contexts; and build their knowledge of key concepts related to literacy and the discipline of English.",
