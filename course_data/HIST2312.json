    "description": "This course investigates how key historians have approached and written about the past. By introducing students to schools of history-writing since about 1900, we discuss major historians in their own context, along with significant concepts that have shaped historical inquiry. We consider how those concepts arose, and why they have been influential. These insights help students develop their own sense of `the historian's craft'.",
    "prerequisites": "This Cornerstone course is a mandatory component of the History major and Ancient History/History major. It is recommended for students who have already taken at least one Gateway course.",
