Key questions to be explored include: Are musical abilities innate? What are the key cognitive processes involved in perceiving, learning, and performing music? How do music and cognitive abilities interact and develop across the lifespan? How can research knowledge be applied to professional music practice? How is music used in applied situations, including artistic, educational, and therapeutic contexts? Research from fields including psychology, neuroscience, education and development will be synthesised to provide students with a theoretically integrated and structured understanding of music cognition and development from rich and diverse perspectives.\n\nPlease note that this course offering may be cancelled if fewer than 10 students enrol.",
