    "description": "Customer focus and patient-centredness are keys to contemporary models of healthcare that has significant benefits not only for patient outcomes but can also improve efficiency and decrease costs for health organisations. \nEvidence-based practice is an approach that is paramount towards improving clinical outcomes.\nThis course integrates these two methodologies. The first part of the course examines the principles underpinning patient-centredness and provides strategies and processes to involve the patient and their support network in treatment decision making and self-management. Clinician-patient communication is a key aspect of patient-centredness and this skill set is examined in some depth, including cultural respect in healthcare.\nThe second part of the course looks at a five-step approach to evidence-based practice that includes the development of a searchable question as well as how to identify, retrieve and implement quality evidence. The role and development of clinical practice guidelines is also examined. \nThe skills and knowledge developed through the course will enable health professionals to integrate both methodologies to improve clinical practice and health service delivery.",
