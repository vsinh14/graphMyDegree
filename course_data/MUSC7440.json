It involves a 20 day (or the equivalent of 160 hours) clinical placement with an approved music therapy supervisor in a setting deemed as appropriate by university staff. This placement experience can also be undertaken independently without a registered music therapist on-site, providing staff within the facility are available to provide supervision and the training site has been approved. The focus of this final clinical placement is on refining the skills necessary to operate as an independent music therapy practitioner, developing skills in all aspects of music therapy program delivery.",
