    "description": "Dietetics practitioners require management skills in order to practice effectively and to contribute to the delivery of food and nutrition services. In addition, many practitioners take on sole positions which usually include management roles, or wish to enter business for themselves. This course introduces issues associated with the management of food and nutrition services to a safe practice level and key skills and concept necessary to run a successful business such as private practice. It uses a systems approach. Topics include planning, quality and safety, leadership, marketing, entrepreneurship, finance, clinical governance and human resource management. These concepts will be applied to nutrition services in a general sense as well as application to business. They will also be applied to food service provision in healthcare and other settings where clients are dependent on the food service for their nutrition. This course provides the theoretical underpinnings for professional practice and assesses elements of the entry level competencies for dietetics.",
