    "description": "The course will develop written and spoken skills. Students will enhance their writing by learning about and applying skills of paragraph development, 'Plain English' style, and the syntactic structure of clauses and phrases. Students will apply these skills in business contexts (for example: reports, proposals, letters) and academic contexts (the research paper and case study). Speaking skills will be enhanced by understanding and applying oral communication in impromptu and formal speaking (the 5 minute 'pitch').",
