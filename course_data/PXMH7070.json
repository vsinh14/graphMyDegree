    "description": "One of the greatest challenges in mental health practice is working with treatment resistant cases. Treatment\nresistant presentations may include any psychiatric disorder that does not respond to standard treatment.\nTreatment resistance is more than complexity created by comorbid diagnostic issues and typically patient\u00c2\u00bfs\npresent with a significant history of failure to respond to intervention or a modest time limited response with\nrelapse. Importantly personality disorder is often part of the clinical presentation in treatment resistant\ncases. Personality disorder has an established role in treatment resistance and requires specialised treatment\napproaches. Typically, psychotherapeutic approaches to working with treatment resistance are based on\nthose developed for working with personality disorder. Specialised psychotherapeutic approaches are\nrequired by this patient group to assist them to improve their level of functioning. The course will focus on\nthe psychological treatment of complex treatment resistant cases and personality disorder as part of the\ndiagnostic presentation. Evidence based and traditional psychotherapy principles will be taught and\ndeveloped in practice to develop the skills base to work effectively with these cases.",
