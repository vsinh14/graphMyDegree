This component of the BEnvSc program extends the independence as a scientist and provides the skills to actively design, perform, analyse and communicate research and innovation. It prepares for entry into the workforce or a research higher degree (such as doctorate) by developing advanced skills. The components of the Honours year are (i) identifying a research project and advisory team, (ii) developing a research proposal, conducting the research guided by the advisor team, and preparing a final research report, and (iii) presenting a proposal and final seminar, and seminar diaries.",
