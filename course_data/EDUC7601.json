    "description": "Literacy is essential for students to be successful in and out of school and to participate effectively in society. Literacy involves more than engagement with traditional texts that require skills in reading, writing, speaking, listening and viewing that encompasses the knowledge, skills and disposition to use language confidently for different purposes in a variety of contexts. In this course, students will discuss and critique contemporary theories and issues for teaching and learning literacy in the 21st century. They will reflect on their own personal literacy capabilities and their role as a teacher of literacy in their teaching areas. They will also investigate how literacy is represented in different teaching areas in curriculum documents. The course will enable students to understand how they can support students with diverse needs in their teaching area to become powerful language users able to effectively comprehend, compose and create texts \u00c2\u00bf including digital and multimodal texts through judicious selection and evaluation of resources and pedagogies. Students will also develop their skills in research, critical analysis, evaluation and communicating with others.",
