    "description": "This course is no longer offered.\nThe vital importance of effectively communicating science is recognised both nationally and internationally, as is the fact that scientists are often bad at doing it. This course emphasizes the practical approaches and underlying processes for translating scientific discoveries and knowledge into forms which significant other groups in society can understand. Four modules highlight good practices in translating science for the media and popular audiences, for policy makers and politicians, business, other scientists and for public education or extension work. The modules include guest lectures and workshops from media experts, business directors, policy strategists and educators. Throughout the course students will analyse and reconfigure science directly relevant to their chosen field of study, or major, in the bio- and environmental sciences, and will develop the skills of accuracy and attention to detail in producing reports. Students will come away from the course with some valuable skills added to their scientific toolbox. The skills learned are essential for scientists to operate in the complex, modern workplace of scientific discovery, working in the corporate and government sectors, scientific development through funding, science industries and commercialisation.",
