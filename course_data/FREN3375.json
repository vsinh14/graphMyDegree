    "description": "The primary focus of this course will be current debates in the field of French language education, seen from a French-speaking perspective. This makes it an ideal course for anyone aiming to teach French as a foreign language or to teach English (or another language) in a French-speaking country. However it will also be of interest to advanced students interested in managing their own learning of French after graduation. Students will design and deliver their own supplementary lessons to selected language learners for 6 weeks of the course.",
