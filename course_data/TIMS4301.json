    "description": "This course is the capstone unit of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Major. The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Incubator course is designed to give students the opportunity to call on and integrate the various learnings from their Major but also their wider Business Degree. Students will do this by deepening an experiential learning journey started in previous `practice\u00c2\u00bf courses in the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Major. The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Incubator course thus has a heavily applied nature with an `impact\u00c2\u00bf focus. Students will work in teams on projects started in previous units or totally new projects by engaging in a short placement/consulting project in a start-up, commercial partner (technology commercialisation project), incubator or accelerator. In this way the course caters for commercial, corporate and social entrepreneurship projects. Course design features rapid cycles of testing the problem but with added emphasis on validating proposed solutions. The deep immersion experience aims to move students closer to commercially-viable solutions as well as more advanced practice and thinking around the entrepreneurial and innovation processes. As such, this course must be completed after one or more of the `practice\u00c2\u00bf course to advance the start-up ideas or commercialisation skills towards impact.",
