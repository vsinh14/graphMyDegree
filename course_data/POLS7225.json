    "description": "This course examines foreign policy and practices of diplomacy in international relations. We first examine theories of foreign policy before exploring the process of foreign policy formation, the role of different sets of actors in influencing foreign policy, key practices or sites of diplomacy and the role of ethical considerations in foreign policy. In the latter half of the course we apply these insights to a series of foreign policy case studies, and conclude with a simulation exercise associated with a hypothetical `global incident'.",
