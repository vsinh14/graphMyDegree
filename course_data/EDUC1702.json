The processes of development across multiple systems will be examined, and students will acquire an understanding of the major influences on child development. Students will explore the implications of developmental issues for children, teachers, and teaching and learning and consider how to apply developmental information in their practice. An understanding of development is a critical foundation for teaching in the primary and middle years of schooling.",
