    "description": "Game theory is the method economists employ to analyse strategic situations. One aim of the course is to teach you some strategic considerations to take into account when making your own choices. A second aim is to predict how other people or organizations behave when they are in strategic settings. We will see that these aims are closely related. We will learn new concepts, methods and terminology. A third aim is to apply these tools to settings from economics, business and finance. The course will emphasize examples. We will also play several games in class.",
