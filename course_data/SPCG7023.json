    "description": "Coaches, athletes, and sport administrators now recognise that physical talent alone does not guarantee success. It is the \"mental game\" that often differentiates performers, especially at the elite level. The role of a high performance coach has evolved beyond instruction in technical, tactical, and physical skills to that which now includes the application of psychological principles to enhancing performance. In this course, students are introduced to the field of performance psychology and will become knowledgeable in training, practice, and research skills that will enable them to get the best out of themselves and others. There is emphasis on both theoretical understanding and personal practice in developing the student's knowledge and application of areas including: learning styles; basic neuroscience; emotion & emotional intelligence; leadership; performance culture; passion; mindset; solution-focused coaching; mindfulness; and acceptance-commitment therapy. With the primary focus of this course being applied in nature, a core outcome of this unit is the development of an individualised program that can be readily implemented into the student's current or future practice. Each weekly seminar has a lecture component and an experiential learning component, which requires students to evaluate each week's topic in relation to their own personal life experiences and to participate in group discussion and coaching practice.",
