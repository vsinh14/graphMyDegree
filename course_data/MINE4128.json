    "description": "Familiarisation with the strata management process and design techniques that are routinely utilised within the Australian underground coal industry such as: pillar mechanics & design, pillar extraction, roof and rib behaviour/reinforcement mechanisms & design, longwall geomechanics & face management and subsidence assessment & control. Detailed geotechnical evaluation and design in underground coal mines. A strong emphasis on the mechanics of the various strata control problems and the fundamental behavioural/failure mechanisms occuring within the strata and associated ground control reinforcement mechanisms.",
