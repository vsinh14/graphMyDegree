    "description": "The goal of this course is aligned with the overall goals of the Injury Research Group, which are to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with intentional and unintentional injuries by promoting excellence in training, research and collaboration. Upon completion of this course, students will have insight into the public health approach to injury and injury prevention, including: epidemiology of injury in Australia, and specifically QLD (leading causes of injury, at-risk groups, risk factors, etc); issues associated with measurement of injury; research methods used in injury prevention; and an understanding of strategies used to prevent injury. The core course content will be complemented by lectures from experts and leading practitioners in the field of injury, as well as practical exercises throughout. The theoretical aspects of the course will be taught in the first part of semester, and these concepts will be applied in several case studies of both unintentional (drowning, burns, falls, RTCs) and intentional (violent assaults, self-harm) injuries in the 2nd half of semester. Upon completion of this course, students will have skills that will enable them to contribute to the development of preventive programs and policies, design effective surveillance systems, evaluate intervention programs and policies, and collect and assess injury data. This course may not be offered if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
