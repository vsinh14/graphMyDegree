    "description": "While elementary logic courses focus on using particular types of logic, this module makes logic itself the subject of investigation. The course will investigate the very limits of reason; more specifically, it will tackle: Henkin's completeness proof for first order logic; and G\u00c3\u00b6del's celebrated incompleteness theorem. Along the way, there will be preparatory discussion of elementary computability theory and model theory",
