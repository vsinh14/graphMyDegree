    "description": "The Early Years Curriculum Foundations course focuses on key concepts that distinguish early years education.\nThe early years of life are a time of extraordinary growth and development, as well being when children are\nintroduced to group education and schooling. In these years, young people have vivid imaginations, creative ideas\nand energy and enthusiasm for life and learning. This course focuses on the importance of creating rich, engaging\nand stimulating learning environments that provide opportunities for young people to think, engage, explore and\ninteract. We explore how carefully interwoven approaches to pedagogy, learning environments, relationships, and\ncurricula cultivate young children's learning. Current rethinking and reconceptualising of early childhood\neducation are embedded to apply ethical and political understandings to learning and teaching. The course will\nprovoke you to question taken for granted practices in education, and provides ideas on how to engage learners\n(of all ages) in integrated authentic experiential learning, as well as navigate the complexities of national and state\nearly years curricula guidelines. You are required to have a current blue card for participation in EDUC1760.",
