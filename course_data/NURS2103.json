    "description": "Students will undertake 120 hours of supervised clinical experience. Clinical practice experience is by integrated and block model placement, depending on the nature of the clinical environment. There is an equal emphasis on practice elements and theoretical understanding, therefore the scheduling of learning activities enables clinical placement shifts to be interspersed with on campus classes in the companion course NURS2012 Nursing in Acute Care Environments. Students are exposed to increasingly complex professional practice concepts under direct Registered Nurse supervision in the clinical practice setting.",
