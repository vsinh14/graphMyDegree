    "description": "This course examines behaviour as a key link in the causative chain for health outcomes and addresses relationships between behavioural risk factors and major chronic diseases. Prevalence, measurement and determinants of health risk behaviours are considered in relation to disease prevention and health promotion. It is highly recommended that students have some prior knowledge of principles of epidemiology, for example the MPH core course PUBH7600 Introduction to Epidemiology or an equivalent. Please note that PUBH7128 builds upon behavioural epidemiology skills covered in PUBH7127 therefore it is advisable to complete PUBH7127 before PUBH7128. This course may not be offered if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
