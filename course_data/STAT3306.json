    "description": "This course teaches the why and how of statistical methods and their computer applications to analyse genome-wide genetic data and phenotypes on large numbers of individuals. Genetic data sets are usually large comprising thousands of individuals. Examples of typical genetic data sets include phenotypic records with a recorded pedigree structure of relationships between individuals or disease cases and controls with DNA polymorphisms measured at millions of locations in the genome. Major topics include: linear mixed models for estimation and prediction, genome-wide association studies, multiple trait analyses. The course focusses on applications in human and livestock genetics and genomics. There is a strong element of hands-on analyses of real-world datasets using R and GCTA.",
