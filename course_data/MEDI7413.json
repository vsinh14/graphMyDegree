While a semester in length, the period of clinical/community work-integrated learning placement will be of six weeks duration. The course may be used to enhance clinical skills in hospital or general practice settings, or may be used to undertake a research project or community based projects broadly related to medicine. The activities of the course may be located locally, or at any place within Australia or internationally, subject to agreement from a project supervisor, and approval from the Course Coordinator. Students are expected to plan and report back on goals and outcomes of the course, including presentation of those outcomes at student symposia.",
