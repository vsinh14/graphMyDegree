Students will learn about important conservation initiatives, and will discuss these initiatives with the people associated with them (researchers, managers, local people...). Visiting these programs in person will make the learning experience much stronger, help students to build important contacts and excite them about conservation. The sorts of initiatives that we will visit will focus on endangered species and threatened habitats, feral pest and weed control, conservation education, reserve design and management and fire management, among other things.",
