    "description": "MIDW2008 is a clinical course which provides the foundation clinical skills and experiences in the Bachelor of Midwifery and Dual degree programs. This course runs concurrently and is integrated with the theoretical courses MIDW2003, MIDW2006 and MIDW2007. Throughout the semester, clinical learning experiences will be planned to integrate with the theoretical concepts covered in the practice problems. Students will be rostered to attend clinical placement on either morning or afternoon shifts for 15 shifts of 8 hours duration. \nIn addition to their clinical placement, students will have planned clinical sessions in the laboratories in their base hospital with their Clinical Lecturer each week. In these sessions, they will learn specific skills that relate to their practice problems and which they may then implement under supervision in their clinical placement. Students will be assessed for competence within the clinical placement and maintain a portfolio of evidence in the acquisition of skill based competencies. Students will provide continuity of care and follow through a minimum of 20 women and maintain a reflective diary to detail their involvement in the care of the woman linked to their theoretical learning.",
