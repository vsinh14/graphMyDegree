    "description": "This course investigates invertebrate plant pests, their identification and classification, their life-cycle and their host relationships from a biosecurity perspective. The main focus of the course is insects, as they are the most numerous of the invertebrate plant pests; however, nematodes, snails and mites will also be covered. Because of the complexity of invertebrate life-cycles, some of which occur in the absence of the host, a biological understanding is essential for appropriate border inspection and post-border surveillance. Basic management approaches to dealing with invertebrate plant pest incursions are discussed in this course. Students become familiarised with international conventions and standards associated with biosecurity.",
