    "faculty": "Engineering, Architecture & Information Technology",
    "school": "Architecture School",
    "units": "4",
    "duration": "One Semester",
    "description": "Students propose solutions to building types and situations that demand novel but rational structural and constructional responses at the macro and micro scale. Employing traditional and emerging design development and documentation methods, proposals are expected to synthesize design ambition with an informed coordination of structure, assembly and envelope. Design-research challenges may include: large spans, rapid assembly or disassembly, prefabrication, mobility or flexibility, and inaccessible or unstable sites.Interaction with consultant teams will form part of this course. Design proposals are expected to critically engage with architectural discourse to produce a project that exhibits detailed integration of conceptual endeavor and technical performance.",
