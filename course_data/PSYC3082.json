    "description": "This course offers students a vibrant personalised and research-based introduction to the major psychotherapies that have been developed to relieve human suffering. This course offers students opportunities to experience personal change through personalised applications of psychotherapy strategies. Students will gain insight into the clinical reasoning and decision making involved in developing treatment plans for clients. Demonstrations of psychotherapy in action will be made available. Psychotherapies covered in the course include those that have been developed many years ago (e.g., Psychodynamic Therapy, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Person-Centred Therapy), and those that have emerged more recently (e.g., Acceptance & Commitment Therapy, Positive Psychology and mindfulness). Issues related to conducting ethical, culturally sensitive and productive therapy with clients are also discussed.",
