DRAM1010 focuses on six main elements of performance: genre, language, body, space, time, and structure. Six texts are studied in detail, from these perspectives. The course culminates in a performance outcome, under the leadership of student directors. DRAM1010 is the compulsory gateway course for the Drama major.",
