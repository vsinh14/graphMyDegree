Students will learn how to apply the most effective tools in developing sustainable business models by exploiting viable, validated opportunities in rapidly changing environments where traditional strategic management approaches are less effective. Course content is based on the Innovation Diamond Model, which has extensive empirical support, and teaches students how to connect the four key processes of innovation strategy, portfolio management, stage gate product/service development process and innovation culture.",
