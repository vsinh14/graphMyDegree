Pre-service teachers will be provided with opportunity to develop knowledge and understanding of relevant curriculum documents. The course will engage pre-service teachers in a critical analysis of recent disciplinary developments in scholarship and professional practice in the teaching of Physics in the senior phase of schooling and science in the junior secondary school. They will be provided with opportunities to develop the appropriate knowledge and teaching strategies to effectively deal with literacy and numeracy demands and learning opportunities that exist in Physics and junior secondary school science. Pre-service teachers will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to practice through (i) designing, implementing and evaluating effective learning and teaching sequences and discipline specific assessment tasks that draw on curriculum, assessment, reporting, and ICT knowledge; and (ii) identifying and designing discipline specific opportunities for professional engagement and communication within the school context, teaching networks and the broader community.",
