    "description": "The family environment is critical for the development of children and for adult adjustment. In this course we will explore key theories and models of the development of parenting and family interactions. We will also look at functional and dysfunctional family relationships and behaviours, and effective ways to assess such interactions. Finally, the course will focus on applications of developmental models to intervention and clinical applications, and the role of parenting interventions in the prevention and management of social, emotional, behavioural and health problems.",
