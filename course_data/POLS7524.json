    "description": "This course examines the global politics of, and practical and ethical challenges to, preventing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) that constitute acts of genocide and mass atrocities. The course will analyse the underlying and immediate causes for the high prevalence of SGBV in mass atrocity situations, and equip students to assess corresponding structural and direct approaches to prevention. Through in-depth historical and contemporary case studies, students will critically evaluate: (1) the evolving politics of preventing sexual and gender-based atrocities; (2) the range of government, humanitarian, health and social service actors involved at the local, national and international levels in prevention efforts; (3) the strategies these various actors adopt; and (4) dilemmas and tensions these actors face in coordinating and delivering effective preventive action.",
