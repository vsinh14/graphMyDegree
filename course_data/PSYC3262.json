    "description": "This course is designed to give students a working knowledge of how to correctly apply evolutionary biology to the study of human behaviour. Evolutionary psychologists use evolutionary biology to make inferences about psychological mechanisms. There are several ways of reconstructing humans' evolutionary past, leading to different sorts of psychological hypotheses. The course covers what psychologists can learn from game theory, hominid archaeology, primate behaviour, and hunter-gatherer cultures, giving an overview of the major sources of hypotheses in evolutionary psychology. Throughout, we will balance theory with critical review of empirical studies in evolutionary psychology.",
