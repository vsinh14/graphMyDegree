    "description": "ENVM1501 is an introduction to the complex interaction among social, political, cultural, economic and ecological factors in the field of environmental management. This course is a foundation for the Bachelor of Environmental Management (hons) that provides insight into the range of courses students will undertake throughout the 4 year degree. Importantly ENVM1501 also allows students to see the relationships between different courses and disciplines and how they are required for successful environmental managers. This course offers a philosophical framework necessary for modern environmental managers to deal with and approach the complex reality of their field. It also places emphasis on thinking about environmental issues and opportunities in a holistic and interdisciplinary way. Although aimed at first year Environmental Management students this course is also undertaken by a range of students in different programs at UQ and from overseas, and therefore it is also a good foundation for anyone interested in environmental management.",
