On completion of the course, students should be able to demonstrate a critical appraisal of major classificatory systems, a critical appraisal of predominant models of aetiology and psychopathology and accurate and clear documentation of assessment. The course assessments, tutorials and lectures are integrated with clinical practice in the professional placement, therefore PSYC7191 must be undertaken concurrently with a placement course.",
