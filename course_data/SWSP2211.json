Together we will examine the sociological aspects of health and illness and how they impact health and wellbeing. The aspects of our lives that challenge our level of wellness are much broader than what we eat, how much we exercise, our intake of alcohol and use of addictive substances. The course addresses the health needs of specific population groups and the associated approaches to health care within the contemporary Australian context.",
