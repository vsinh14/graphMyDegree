    "description": "Ore Body Modelling introduces advanced students from Geology, Geophysics, Mining Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, and Environmental Sciences to 3-D geological modelling and mineral resources reporting. It covers the concepts of sample collection and quality assurance/quality control procedures, mineral resources and reserve, cut-off grade, nugget effect; the application of statistical and numerical methods as they relate to resource estimation and the use of 3-D modelling packages applied in the Australian and global mining industries. It also addresses the basic codes on reporting mineral resources (VALMIN and JORC codes).",
