The conceptual framework integrates a range of contemporary theoretical perspectives that address the aetiology of psychopathology in children and adolescents, as well as family problems such as child abuse and neglect. The course will present assessment methods and provide an introduction to a range of treatment models. A combined academic and practical approach will be adopted with workshops scheduled in place of lectures to provide opportunities for experiential learning.",
