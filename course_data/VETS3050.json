It develops students understanding of pathophysiological and pharmacological principles involved in actions of these chemicals, before moving on to developing skills in the applied and/or therapeutic aspects of this information, including routes of delivery and practical application. This will include therapeutics and introductory anaesthesia training as a prelude to clinical medicine, and dose calculations, fluid therapy and acid-base therapeutics.",
