    "description": "There is a great deal of writing about war, violence, and trauma but often little about how such issues are addressed in post-conflict situations. Peacebuilding brings together the theory and practice of conflict resolution, humanitarian intervention, human rights and development. The development of peacebuilding is becoming one of the most pressing contemporary international issues as the world seeks answers to entrenched civil war conflict. Peacebuilding challenges confront organisations from the United Nations to international non-government organisations and states from Afghanistan to Australia. In this course we develop an understanding of contemporary theories of peacebuilding and critically engage with peacebuilding at both a theoretical and practical level.",
