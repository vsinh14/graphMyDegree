Students critically engage with established and emerging analytical methodologies for advanced tonal structures in music across a broad range of solo, orchestral and choral genres. Upon completion of the course, students demonstrate fluency in the application of music-analytical tools in tonal contexts, a command of the technical vocabulary used in constructing tonal textures, and the ability to critically appraise different formal models across tonal repertoire.\nPlease note that this course offering may be cancelled if fewer than 10 students enrol.",
