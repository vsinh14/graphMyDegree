The role of the midwife in early recognition of critical illness of childbearing women and identification of the need for a rapid response and/or timely referral to the multidisciplinary healthcare team to achieve safe, high quality care based on current evidence will be explored, together with the need for a knowledgeable and skilled multidisciplinary team who is well rehearsed in the treatment of maternal and neonatal emergency response. Students will have the opportunity to practice skills of monitoring, assessing and caring for the woman and baby with a critical illness, in a simulated environment.",
