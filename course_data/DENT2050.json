The course will use simulated learning environments including pre-clinical laboratories to provide students with the opportunity to attain competency in the clinical skills required to provide preventive dental care and simple dental restorations. Students will also develop their clinical skills in a clinical environment and will begin seeing patients in the second semester. The focus is the dental management of healthy adults. Each week, students will have 6 hours of pre-clinical laboratories and 3 hours of clinical work.",
