Topics covered in the course include modern material culture identification, recording and analysis of ceramic, glass, metal, bone and shell artefacts, and the interpretation of archaeological collections and sites. The course introduces students to the theory and method of key areas of historical archaeology, and the use of practical and integrated problem-solving laboratory based exercises enables students to put into practice many of the concepts discussed throughout the course. Problem-based learning exercises and group work are run weekly in the archaeology laboratories in which students are required to describe, measure, draw, record and interpret historical archaeological artefacts from the School\u00c2\u00bfs reference collections.",
