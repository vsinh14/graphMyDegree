    "description": "This course starts from the assumption once expressed by Albert Einstein, that \"imagination is more important than knowledge\". We study artistic sources, such as poetry, visual art, film, and music to gain new perspectives on key political issues, such as war, terrorism and poverty. The course introduces key debates in aesthetics and then moves on to apply them in practice through various alternative teaching tools, such as situational exercises and interactive learning.",
