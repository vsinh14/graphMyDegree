    "description": "EDUC4702 is the final of three courses within the BED Primary and Middle Years Programs that focus on the teaching and learning of English and literacy. Three interrelated aspects of the teaching profession provide a developmental framework for the three courses: knowing yourself as a literacy/English teacher; knowing your students; and knowing the disciplinary content of the subject English as well as the place of literacy teaching and learning within other curriculum areas. In this course students will begin to develop their role as a critical and reflective practitioner through participation in professional communities of educators, expand their disciplinary knowledge of English and literacy, and prepare work that reflects current curriculum frameworks and policies as well as engage students from diverse backgrounds in intellectually challenging learning experiences.",
