    "description": "The course will investigate the full breadth of experimental paradigms for genetic analysis in four multicellular model genetic organisms (Arabidopsis, Drosophila, C. elegans and mouse) through a structured series of lectures with a focus on the primary research literature. A series of research paper discussions will be integrated with the lectures. In the latter portion of the course, students will select an academic mentor who will assign a research problem to them. The academic mentor will then guide students in the development of a research proposal designed to address the assigned problem.",
