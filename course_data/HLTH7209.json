    "description": "This course explores the nature of role and leadership in health services in an environment requiring organisational change.This course is presented in two parts. The first part of this course looks at what a positive organisational culture is within the context of health services, examines the impact of poor culture and work climate on the organisation, and presents an intervention to deal with stressors and improve the work environment. The second part of this course deals with the concept of personal and organisational change, suggesting methods and techniques to facilitate change effectively at both levels. Participants responsible for implementing any new process or service, or even just a significant variation or adaptation of current practice or processes, will benefit from this course.",
