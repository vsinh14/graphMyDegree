The scond part of the course will examine how systems and schools are responding to the call for reform in the middle years. Case studies of a range of middle schooling practices wil be analysed. The analysis wil focus on specific developments in curriculum, pedagogy and assessment in these case study schools and the implications of these reforms for students' academic and social outcomes.\n\nThis course may not be offered if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
