    "description": "Semester 2 2016 - Regulating Warfare: Ethics, Law, and Politics.\nWhy, how, and on which principles do we seek to regulate warfare? Isn't the very idea of regulating armed conflict contradictory since it requires co-operation between parties unable to avoid resort to violence in the first place? The theme of this course is that regulating of warfare represents the rich meeting ground between ethical, legal, and political principles and we need to explore how these interact with each other.\nAdvanced topics in political science, not covered in other courses, and available only under special circumstances (for example, course to be given by a visiting lecturer in a specialty area that is not usually available). Regardless of changes in the content of the course, students can only take the course once. Please contact the Senior Administrative Officer (Academic) in the School of Political Science and International Studies for information on the current topic.",
