    "description": "This course will have its first offering in Semester 1, 2019. This course provides a bridge for students who have successfully completed the Sustainable Energy MicroMasters Program and wish to complete the Master of Sustainable Energy on campus. In addition to providing a refresher on energy fundamentals, the course provides students with an opportunity to apply their energy skills and knowledge in a research setting. Through a series of lectures, discussions and group work opportunities, students will be encouraged to engage on key topics around what will be required to transition to a sustainable energy future. Students will be asked to develop and present a Boardroom style presentation on an energy related topic to their cohort of students as well as other University of Queensland academics. Students will be supported in developing leadership, teamwork and research skills and in February will undertake a field trip to expose them to an energy intensive Queensland town. \nThis course is incompatible with ENGY7000, 7001, 7002 and 7003.",
