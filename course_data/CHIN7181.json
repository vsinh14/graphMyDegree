    "description": "This is a year-long course by research. It is designed to enable students to undertake research in the area of translation and interpreting theories and their application to translation and interpreting practice. The research should both reflect students' factual knowledge of translation/interpreting and demonstrate a sound understanding of theories. Since translation/interpreting is an interdisciplinary subject, research from different disciplinary angles is encouraged. Students are required to write a thesis of 15,000-20,000 words, which should demonstrate reasonable theoretical depth. Through this course, students' research ability will be developed or further enhanced, which will prepare them for further research in the future or study towards a higher degree.",
