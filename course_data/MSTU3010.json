    "description": "Studies in Aesthetics and the Creative Arts is the capstone course for the BCA. The course explores the re-emergence of aesthetics as a significant critical discourse in the creative arts, and provides students with the theoretical and conceptual tools to interrogate their own and others' creative thought and practice. In addition to historicizing the term, the course contextualizes Western aesthetics for students across the disciplinary bases (theatre, music, writing) of the BCA and encourages them to consider the ways in which aesthetics can be a means to develop the creative potential of their disciplines in contemporary cultural contexts.",
