    "description": "The principal purpose of this course is to introduce researchers and practitioners to the decision-making and governance processes embedded in responses to humanitarian emergencies, illustrative of mass atrocity crimes, large-scale conflict, or environmental disasters. The course therefore equips graduates with a holistic understanding of the complexities of humanitarian emergencies, and respective responses, they will face in their future careers. The course uses the case-study method to examine different humanitarian emergencies with unlike causal pathways, varying timelines, but high levels of lethality to critically engage with the decision-making and governance complexities that influence responses to crises such as genocide, war, and natural disasters.",
