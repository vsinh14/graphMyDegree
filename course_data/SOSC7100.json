    "description": "Students work by themselves, under the individual supervision of a member of the academic staff of one of the following schools: School of Social Science; School of Political Science and International Studies; or School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. This allows students of exceptional ability to engage in a substantial research project. Students need to be self-motivated and self-disciplined and will determine and develop their own project in consultation with their supervisor. At the outset of their research, it is vital for students to swiftly identify and focus upon a clear research question. The semester then involves independent reading and research, regular contact between student and supervisor, and the preparation of a 10,000 to 12,000-word report. This course can only be undertaken if the planned project is of immediate interest to a supervisor in one of the three Schools. Prospective students must themselves identify and approach a potential supervisor and discuss their proposed research question; supervisors are not assigned by the Program Director, however they can assist in facilitating potential supervisors, if necessary.",
