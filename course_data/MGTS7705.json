    "description": "Good strategy creates value for an organisation and its stakeholders. However, in an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment, leaders must both develop and execute strategy as an interlinked and ongoing process. \n\nStrategy in Action addresses this challenge by moving well beyond traditional strategic planning. It demonstrates how a `logic of integration\u00c2\u00bf and a `logic of execution\u00c2\u00bf combine to deliver good strategy, irrespective of whether the organisation is run for profit, not for profit or is in the public sector. \n\nThis leading edge courses uses live case studies and extensive class interaction to enable participants to develop and execute business models that deliver performance.",
