    "description": "This course will involve the development of practical research skills and the development of intellectual skills in the formulation of a hypothesis and testing it by appropriate experiments. This will involve the development of a research proposal that outlines the work that students will undertake in their research project. This proposal is intended to provide an early focus for project work. It may also form the basis of the introductory research report chapter. Students will learn to keep detailed written records of all laboratory and field work and report the details of their research project in the form of a substantial research report.",
