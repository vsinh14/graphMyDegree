    "description": "(Course last offered 2013.)\nThe course provides students with the theory and tools for electromagnetic modelling of RF, microwave and optical structures and introduces them to measurement techniques for the characterisation of such structures. The course will highlight application of electromagnetic design to the fields of microwave and optical communications, bioengineering and imaging. One of the key features of the course is the close relationship between modelling and the laboratory test and measurement procedures.",
