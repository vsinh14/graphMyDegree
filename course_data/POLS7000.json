    "description": "This course aims to provide students with foundational knowledge and skills relevant to the study of politics across the areas of Governance and Public Policy, Peace and Conflict Studies and International Relations. Before one can write well in politics, one must be able to read well. Thus, the course begins with consideration of the importance of critically reading texts in order to recognize both argument and underlying assumptions. Doing so requires acknowledgment of the open-ended or essentially contested nature of many of the concepts that are used in political discourse and analysis. Such recognition equips us to be informed readers and therefore more skilful analysts and writers in our chosen field. Through close reading of texts, interactive class exercises and a number of written assignments students will have the opportunity to build their analytical and writing skills in this field.",
