It is a year-long course and is intended to demonstrate the capability of students to conceive and carry out original, high-level research. The individual research thesis, which is supervised by a member of the academic staff, is assessed on a number of grounds. These relate to the student's command of the chosen topic from initial conception of the problem, through its resolution via appropriate research strategies, to clear presentation and insightful interpretation of what has been discovered.",
