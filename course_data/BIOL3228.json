    "description": "This course is no longer offered.\nThe ocean is a wild and dangerous place for the animals that live there and for humans that venture into it. This course explores the interactions between marine animals, their pathogens and parasites. From toxic animal venoms, through host defences against the marine pathogens that threaten them, to the diverse world of parasitism, understanding the complex interactions between marine organisms is leading to major advances in marine bioproducts, aquaculture and biosecurity. Students enrolling in BIOL3228 will gain broadly applicable techniques in biochemistry, immunology, microbiology and parasitology. They will learn theoretical and practical skills against an applied background of novel pharmaceuticals, disease prevention in fish farming, and control of invasive species in Australian waters",
