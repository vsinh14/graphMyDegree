    "description": "This course introduces students to the archaeology of Anatolian Turkey (Asia Minor) from its earliest occupation in the Palaeolithic to the pre-classical Iron Age, ending with Alexander's conquest in 334-333 BC. The course uses archaeological evidence of settlement, material culture, economy and environment to explore our understanding of the social, political, cultural and economic transformations in a vibrant and important area of the Eastern Mediterranean including the origins of humanity, origins and spread of farming, the first civilisations and the development and fall of empires, including the Hittites and Persia. Key sites and archaeologists will be described and current debates investigated, including the ethics of archaeology in Turkey and issues surrounding repatriation of cultural heritage items.",
