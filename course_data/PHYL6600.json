    "description": "This course builds on students\u00c2\u00bf knowledge of exercise physiology, studying the importance of exercise physiology in understanding sport performance. The course emphasises: understanding the physiologic requirements of sport; evaluating the importance of physiology systems in athlete performance; sport-specific adaptations to physical training and comparisons of different forms of training. The course examines advanced principles underlying physiological exercise testing, with emphases on sport specificity, laboratory-based and field-based testing. The course will also examine the important role of exercise physiology in sustaining and enhancing sport performance.\nThis course is available for Study Abroard/Exchange students.",
