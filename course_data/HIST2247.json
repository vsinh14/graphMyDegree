    "description": "Across the long twentieth century, Australian society and culture was transformed. There were dramatic, even spectacular events: Federation; the First World War; the expansion of cities and social worlds in the 1920; the travails caused by the Great Depression; the upheavals of the Second World War; new migrations from the 1950s onwards; the revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s; and much more. There were equally significant changes to the way people understood their world, to their thought systems and their beliefs. This course explores these and other events and developments in Australia since 1901, placing an emphasis on their impact on ordinary people and everyday life.\nThis course may not run if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.",
