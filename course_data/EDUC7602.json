    "description": "Numeracy is the capacity to deal effectively with the mathematical demands of life and is necessary for personal enablement, effective civic and economic participation, and social equity. Drawing on contemporary literature, this course will explore the nature of numeracy, what it means to be numerate in the 21st century, and how all teachers can contribute to developing the numeracy capabilities of their students. The importance of numeracy is recognised in the Australian Curriculum where it is a General Capability to be developed in subjects across the curriculum. Pre-service teachers will be provided with opportunities to develop the appropriate knowledge and teaching strategies to analyse curriculum documents and effectively deal with inherent numeracy demands and numeracy learning opportunities that exist in learning areas. Theoretical knowledge will be applied to develop pedagogical knowledge for designing effective numeracy tasks and strategies for assessing numeracy learning.
