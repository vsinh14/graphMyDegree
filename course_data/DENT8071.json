    "description": "To be conversant with the contemporary research and clinical literature within the chosen discipline, students will require an \n understanding of scientific methodology and the ability to critically analyse published research and where appropriate, transfer this to the clinical situation. Part of this training is the preparation and conduct of an approved research project within the chosen DClinDent discipline. Students should be capable of devising a small research project and bringing it through the development stages including ethics approval by an institutional ethics committee where required. The project is usually a part of an ongoing research theme within the School and should be devised and conducted in close association with the research supervisor/s within the same discipline. Accredited postgraduate training programs in Australia and New Zealand have the requirement for an integrated one year full-time equivalent research training within the chosen discipline. This is regulated by the Australian Dental Council and subsequently becomes a part of the requirements for registration as a specialist following graduation.",
