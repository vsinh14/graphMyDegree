Students analyse information obtained during their research and prepare a report suitable for publication. Students participate in fortnightly group supervision to guide the implementation of their project, analysis of data and plan the write up of results. Students also consult with a tutor who can provide more specific advice as required. It is however, expected that the student will demonstrate capacity to work independently.",
