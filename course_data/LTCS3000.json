    "description": "This course will study the place of Latin American cultural thought within the Western culture. It will discuss questions related to centre/periphery, appropriation/rewriting, and orthodoxy/subversion in cultural studies in order to address two interrelated sets of issues: first, that Latin American thought has been constructed as a marginal paradigm in the symbolic space of Western culture; and second, that theoretical products specific to Latin America - Mestizaje, Magical Realism, Liberation Theology - elaborate on European systems of thought and radically transform them. Texts in Spanish/Portuguese will be studied in English translation.\nThis course may be cancelled if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.",
