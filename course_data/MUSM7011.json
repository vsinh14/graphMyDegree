    "description": "This course offers students the opportunity to understand issues in digital heritage from a critical perspective. It will cover three key areas in digital heritage: 1) theoretical perspectives on digital heritage in museums, archives, libraries and other collecting institutions; 2) practice-led approaches including methodologies for the recording of cultural expressions using digital media and their representation; 3) a consideration of the ethics of digital heritage, good practice and sustainability. Students will undertake two areas of assessed work: 1) a research essay synthesizing journal publications and key theories; 2) a methodology project involving the collection of original data that will address areas relevant to digital heritage. The project involves recording, collating and presenting cultural material using digital media such as digital photographs or film of objects, events and places and presenting this through website design, blog design, or social networking devices.",
