    "description": "This course is a reflection upon, and analysis of, legal orders within, between and above a nation's domestic legal system. Today, the scope of legal regulation is no longer limited to national territories. This course will delve into the nature of international law, supranational law, comparative law, domestic law and legal pluralism, including their interconnections and points of conflict. These global issues impact upon individuals and the choices available to legislators and decision-makers. This requires a framework that sees law as a global phenomenon with fluid boundaries.",
