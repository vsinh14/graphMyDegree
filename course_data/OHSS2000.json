The course focuses on the impacts of work and the work environment on the human body. The teaching approach will utilise lectures, case studies and scenario based learning to examine the health impacts on bodily systems and functions including: the respiratory, reproductive, sensory, nervous, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and renal systems, hepatic function and metabolism. Occupational infections and occupationally derived cancers will also be discussed. The role of chemicals in the development of occupational illness and disease will be discussed within the framework of the basic principles of toxicology.",
