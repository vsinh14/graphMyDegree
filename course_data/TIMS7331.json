    "description": "The purpose of this course is to allow students to continue to learn how to build their social or other entrepreneurship projects, which they started in TIMS7329, TIMS7325 or TIMS7301, into social enterprises OR for-profit start-ups. The course focuses on skills relevant to initial execution and incubation of their projects. Students will be judged in terms of customer impact, team skill development, personal development and business development results achieved. These assessments are seen as learning tools to motivate students to drive results from their projects. While the course has a strong practical application focus this is supported on a weekly basis with select theory and skill-building coaching. Successful students will graduate with tangible evidence of their ability to create social, team, personal and business value.",
