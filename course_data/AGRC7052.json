    "description": "Biosecurity refers to the control and risk mitigation of hazardous biological agents. Issues relating to infectious diseases, invasive pests, biological control programs, and intentional misuse of biological agents means that an understanding of biosecurity is an essential competence for those working in the biological disciplines. This course aims to provide students with a fundamental understanding of what constitutes such biological hazards, the theory and practice of avoiding or controlling these hazards, the regulatory framework for managing biosecurity, and opportunities to explore topical examples of biosecurity issues. The course content will re-contextualise and complement material from other course material relating to infectious diseases, epidemiology, ecology and animal and plant science.",
