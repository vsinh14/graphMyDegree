    "description": "PUBH1102 is a core course in the Bachelor of Health Sciences and introduces a number of key concepts and ideas that will be taken up in more detail by other core and elective courses. The course helps students gain a broad understanding of the history and overarching principles of public health, and the role of the discipline in improving health and reducing health inequities. In this course, students study the multiple and interacting factors which impact on human health, including bio-physiology; behaviour; culture; societal structure (social, political, economic, and built context); and the natural environment. Students are also introduced to the concepts and tools used to assess and measure the health status of populations, analyse the determinants of health, and determine the effectiveness of interventions. PUBH1102 will provoke interest and discussion, leaving students with an appreciation of the wider context in which human health occurs. Whether students are inspired to pursue a career path in public health at the graduate level, or are going on to further study in public health or the other health sciences, this course provides them with a solid, broad foundation upon which to build.",
