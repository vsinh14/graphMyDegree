    "description": "This course examines the relationship between Indigenous and mainstream conceptions of political community, sovereignty, power, policy, rights, diplomacy and conflict to question, reflect, and expand upon dominant understandings of (international) politics. These themes are examined in the context of the development of transnational Indigenous activism in the late 20th Century and the challenges of ongoing conflicts between Indigenous peoples and settlers in settler-colonial societies. The course will increase your understanding of Indigenous peoples, advance creative thinking about alternative ways of constituting and maintaining political order, and enhance capacities for working across cultural difference.",
