    "description": "Innovation matters to everyone, including managers in small or large organisations, start-up entrepreneurs, those in government roles, or teachers. This course looks at how individuals and organisations use creativity and design thinking skills to identify and choose opportunities that enable innovation. Creative problem solving skills are developed and enhanced through a range of real world activities. An overview of design thinking tools is provided to help students understand design thinking as a problem solving approach. Ideas developed through these processes are then applied to a customer discovery approach to understand their value in the market place.",
