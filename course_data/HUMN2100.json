    "description": "The course focuses on the revolutionary, creative impulses embodied in a series of works of art, literature, and thought that have regularly been appraised as especially eminent and influential\u00c2\u00bfand that have licensed vital speculation, moral and political change, and artistic adventurousness since their first appearance. In what ways did these works disrupt and transform their worlds? What challenges do they throw out to us today, living in vastly different circumstances from those in which they were conceived? Many of the literary, artistic, spiritual, and intellectual masterpieces featured on the course are in severe, tense contradiction with each other. But all of them are indisputably important, shaping thinking, feeling, and imagining in numerous spheres of human life. We will consider why and how it is that some works of the imagination or intellect have come to be considered \u00c2\u00bfgreat\u00c2\u00bf, and whether or not they are still relevant to us today.",
