    "description": "This course is designed to interrogate the theoretical underpinnings of practices of explanation and understanding in International Relations (IR), and to provide learners with the means to formulate and use theories and theorems in their own investigations at an advanced level. We take a problem-driven approach to investigate, evaluate and reconstruct different theoretical approaches, and to unpacking their respective limits and potentials. Our focus is hence on `theories as practices\u00c2\u00bf, as significant elements for building compelling political analyses.",
