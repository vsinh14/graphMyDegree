    "description": "Students in this course explore architecture's role in commercial development and global consumer culture. Students learn to work with the quantitative language of financial speculation. In parallel, they respond to the theoretical consideration of architecture's relationship to commerce, from populism to corporate branding and critical theory to projective architecture. Design proposals are expected to critically balance the expectations of commercial development against broader societal needs for sustainable and accessible cities. Developing an understanding of development triggers, legislative frameworks and 'commercial' construction processes is integral to this course. Projects range from businesses and shopping centres, to high-rise towers and hotels.",
