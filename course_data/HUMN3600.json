    "description": "This course allows students to apply the skills they have developed in previous courses, and to an extent functions as a bridge between the university and the work place. A main goal of the course is to provide students with a 'futures literacy' with a key outcome enabling students to see that the future isn't an abstract concept, or something that is pre-determined. A key pedagogy underpinning the course will be the relevance of systems thinking for analysing varied and uncertain futures. The course will be outwardly focused in terms of engagement with industry (government, corporations, non-profits, social movements), particularly organisations that are pro-actively working on transitions to a more sustainable, just and equitable social future, based on the latest developments in social science research. It includes a potential internship and/or networking opportunities and work place experience.",
