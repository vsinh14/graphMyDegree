    "description": "The disparities between health outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians are well documented. The health sector, in all of its complexity, is developing and implementing strategies to contribute to the Federal Government\u00c2\u00bfs commitment to 'Close the Gap'. Preparing and training graduates to work in the sport, exercise, physical and nutrition sector is recognised as one important component of meeting the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and reducing the disparities in health outcomes in Australia. This course will make a contribution by creating culturally aware, knowledgeable and sensitive health professionals that have the capacity to competently work with Indigenous people.",
