    "description": "This course conveys fundamental principles of human factors psychology, which is the science and practice of understanding the fit between people and the systems they work with. In the course, human-system fit is analysed from perceptual, cognitive, social, and organisational points of view. The course also introduces key ideas underlying cognitive systems engineering, which views human-system fit as a complex adaptive system. During practical sessions, students investigate fundamental theories and principles underlying human factors psychology, perform and analyse small experiments, and assess case studies. Occasional guest lecturers visit from different kinds of complex safety-critical systems, such as road and rail transport centres, commercial aviation, aerospace, healthcare (medical, nursing, allied health), and emergency response centres.",
