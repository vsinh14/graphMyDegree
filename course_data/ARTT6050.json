    "description": "What is time? Is time like a river? Does it `flow'? What separates the `now' from the `then'? To what extent can the past and the future be regarded as objective properties of reality? What is the relationship between time and space? Is there more than one time? When does the present end? What is the time of art? This course considers the ways in which concepts of time and temporality are represented or embodied in art and art history. Seminars explore various aspects of art and the metaphysics of time including: heterochronicity and the cultural relativity of time; anachronism, or art's capacity to `break' temporal borders; time and the moving image; durational art and performance; concepts of the Everywhen in Indigenous Australian cultures; and melancholia and the politics of time. The course is run as an intensive advanced reading group over the course of ten weeks, with one 2.5 hour seminar per week.",
