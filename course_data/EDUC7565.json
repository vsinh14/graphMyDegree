    "description": "EDUC7565 Introduction to Teaching Mathematics is the first of two Mathematics Curriculum courses in the Master of Teaching (Primary) program. The course prepares preservice teachers to be effective classroom teachers through a comprehensive introduction to the learning and teaching of Mathematics across the primary years. Teaching Mathematics requires specific knowledge, understanding and skills in interpreting the Mathematics Curriculum and developing a wide range of pedagogies and strategies. Throughout the course, preservice teachers will experience the process of immersion in Mathematics concepts through diverse activities and pedagogies to develop understanding of implications for student learning and teaching. This course will introduce the Australian Mathematics Curriculum across primary year levels and content strands. How Mathematics is used across the curriculum in Numeracy contexts and use of ICT to enhance learning and teaching will also be presented. The course emphasises the importance of research and evidence-based practice to inform the learning and teaching process.",
