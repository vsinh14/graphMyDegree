    "description": "Cultural diversity is fundamental to the human condition, and an existential condition of world politics. But how should we understand cultural diversity, and how does it affect the play of politics globally? This course explores the complex and contested nature of culture, as well as the multiple axes of cultural diversity, and examines the effects of cultural identities, values, and practices on domestic and international politics. It begins by comparing constitutive, strategic, and institutional perspectives on culture, and then explores the following topics: culture and international order; religion in world politics; the `clash\u00c2\u00bf of civilisations; and ethnicity and nationalism. It concludes by examining the challenges of cultural diversity for the modern international order, focusing on questions of sovereign equality, international law, and human rights.",
