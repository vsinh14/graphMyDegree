    "description": "Geochemistry & Geochronology is a quantitative course that introduces third-year science students to the basic principles and practical applications of geochemical and geochronological tools. The course provides the necessary training for the professional geoscientists to interpret and use geochemical information. The course provides the most essential background for students interested in pursuing advanced degrees in Earth and Environmental Sciences, and it underpins the undergraduate education connection with the Research Strength area of Isotope Analysis, Trace Element Chemistry & Geochronology.\n\nThe course aims at teaching advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students the basic geochemical concepts necessary for interpreting geochemical data. It introduces conceptual knowledge of processes controlling major element, trace element, and isotopic differentiation in the solar system; it covers basic analytical techniques suitable for elemental and isotopic measurements; it shows, through practical assignments, the necessary steps for data analysis, interpretation, and reporting.\n\nThe course is delivered as two three-hour sessions per week. The practical component is based on numerical exercises on geochemical applications. Some of the practical exercises are built around data generated in the various geochemistry laboratories at The University of Queensland. The course provides essential training for Geologist and Environmental Scientists interested in exploration and environmental geochemistry. It also provides essential training for advanced research in the Earth Sciences.",
