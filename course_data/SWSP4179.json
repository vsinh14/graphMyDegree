In weekly seminars and a series of intensive focused workshops, the aim is to develop students' critical reasoning, assessment and intervention skills with individuals, families and groups and caregivers in diverse health contexts. The course uses weekly interactive scenario-based leaning case studies, taught with social work practitioners, to examine and apply concepts of inclusive practice and knowledge-based and ethical decision-making in assessment and intervention, and demonstrates skills in professional writing, team work; individual and systems advocacy skills; and understanding and application of outcome-focused practice and use of evidence for best practice. In addition, students will participate in a series of more focused themed workshops which address generic knowledge and skills for professional social work practice such as working wth alcohol and drug issues and grief and loss.\n\nStudents will attend weekly 3 hour seminars and weekly 3 hour workshops during the semester.",
