    "description": "Enabling students to develop proficiency in numeracy and literacy is currently a major concern of all Australian education authorities. Competence in literacy and numeracy has been identified as being essential to scholarships, lifelong learning and active citizenship. While all secondary HPR teacher educators need to demonstrate high levels of literacy and numeracy competence, they need to develop discipline specific literacy and numeracy knowledge, skills and pedagogy that constitute expertise in these general capabilities. Furthermore, they must become proficient in guiding their students towards the attainment of such expertise. This course focuses on the literacy and numeracy demands encountered in secondary schooling contexts in Australia. In this course, pre-service teachers will identify essential aspects of literacy and numeracy within HPE. They will reflect upon and consolidate the literacy and numeracy knowledge and skills they need and the pedagogical strategies required to assist their future students.",
