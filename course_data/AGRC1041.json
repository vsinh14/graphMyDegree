    "description": "Understanding the structure and function of cells and cell components is intrinsic to defining how tissues, organ systems and ultimately whole organisms operate in normal, healthy conditions. This includes how cells communicate with each other and regulate coordinated activity. This course describes basic physiological principles that govern cellular activity. It also provides students with the opportunity to explore the ultrastructure of cells and link form to function using observational, research and experimental approaches.",
