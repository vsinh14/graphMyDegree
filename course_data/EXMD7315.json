    "description": "EXMD7315 involves students undertaking supervised clinical practice in affiliated hospitals (public and private), clinics and community settings as required for accreditation as Exercise Physiologists with Exercise and Sports Science Australia. The School of Human Movement Studies is committed to the reduction of urban bias in the content of its programs. Students undertaking clinical practicum as part of their programs in the School of Human Movement Studies could, therefore, be allocated placements outside the Brisbane metropolitan area. Where allocated placements are rural/regional, students should expect to fund these places independently. Allocation of placements will be as equitable as possible. Issues of hardship will be dealt with at the discretion of the Practicum & Clinical Education Manager and Program Coordinator.",
