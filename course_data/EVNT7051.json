    "description": "This course explores the interface between venue, space, people and performance in diverse event settings. The course serves to showcase both commonalities and contrasts in creative and logistical elements of implementing an event. Linkages between the event concept, pre-production activities, finalisation of event schedules, and event execution and closing out of the event are addressed in this course. Students will apply the theoretical constructs acquired in EVNT7053 through interfacing with a real world event.",
