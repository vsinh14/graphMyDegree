    "description": "Modern physics has arrived at a point where the picture it provides of natural phenomena is radically different from the picture stemming from our everyday experience. This course is delivered jointly by Physics and Philosophy and will give a non-specialist account of the main theories of modern physics---special and general relativity, quantum physics and cosmology\u00c2\u00bfand introduce students to key metaphysical problems that these new theories suggest concerning the nature of matter, space, time and causation.",
