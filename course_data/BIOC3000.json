    "description": "The understanding of molecular structure & function is of central importance to students undertaking a major in the biological or chemical fields. This course focuses on concepts of DNA/RNA, protein, lipid & carbohydrate relating structure to function. Some content and assignments are based on current literature describing recent DNA & protein structures & how structure can inform about function. Laboratory work will emphasize the techniques required to analyse biomolecules. Students will integrate theoretical knowledge with experimental data.",
