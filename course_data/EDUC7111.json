    "description": "EDUC7111 aims to develop a broad-based understanding of the political, economic, socio-cultural and ethical dimensions of globalization and their effects on education policy and practice. Students will have the opportunity to engage with critical debates and situated case studies from both the `West/Global North' and 'East/Global South'. Topics examined will include the educational needs of mobile populations (eg refugees, asylum seekers, migrants), policymaking processes by states under globalising conditions, the rise of knowledge economies and Asian education hubs, the gendered effects of globalising policies and the limits and possibilities of audit technologies and Anglophone curricula. This course seeks to open up an intellectual space to develop an 'empowered imagination' for the educator.\n\nThis course may not be offered internally if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
