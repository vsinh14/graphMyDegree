    "description": "This course is the first of a series of three courses within the BEd (Primary and MYS) degrees that focus on the teaching and learning of Literacy and English. Three interrelated aspects of the teaching profession provide a developmental framework for the three courses: knowing yourself as a literacy/English teacher; knowing your students; and knowing the disciplinary content of the subject English as well as the place of literacy teaching and learning within other curriculum areas. In this first course of the sequence, students will investigate their own literate identities; explore the variety of literacy experiences available to students from diverse backgrounds; and begin to build a repertoire of knowledge and practice related to the use of key literacy concepts across curriculum areas.",
