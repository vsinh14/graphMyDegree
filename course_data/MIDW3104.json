    "description": "This course will provide students with the opportunity to consolidate their midwifery practice, knowledge, skills and clinical experience gained in prerequisite clinical practice courses. The role of the graduate midwife as an effective team member of the multidisciplinary team will be critiqued. It is a requirement of this course that all Continuity of Care experiences (CoCe) are completed. Student's will be assessed for clinical competence and finalise their portfolio of evidence in preparation for graduate practice. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all of the clinical midwifery practice experience including the achieved numbers of births in which they acted as the primary accoucheur and the required number of CoCe are documented in the Midwifery electronic portfolio.",
