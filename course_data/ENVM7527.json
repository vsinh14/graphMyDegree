The interdisciplinary projects may be for a particular external client, who would liaise/work with the student teams, or on a public issue/policy of concern. Where appropriate, project teams could be formed across the entire program and Fields; for instance engineers, agriculturalists, business managers and social scientists could form a problem-solving team.",
