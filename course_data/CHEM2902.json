    "description": "This course is specifically designed for students enrolled in the BAdvSc(Hons) with an interest in Chemistry. The fundamentals of Organic, Main Group and Physical Chemistry taught in CHEM2060 will be built upon and explored in depth. The additional advanced content will enhance understanding of the fundamental concepts but also provide a more coherent foundation for third year chemistry courses and for research in the field of chemistry. The additional content in the course will include problem based-learning workshops in advanced problem solving. This will clearly be integral to producing students with theoretical problem solving skills and the ability to communicate.",
