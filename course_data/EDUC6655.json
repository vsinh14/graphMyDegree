    "description": "Identifying youth disadvantage, diversity and risk is an important part of the educational process if young people are to reach their full potential in their adult years. The identification and intervention processes can also be very challenging, time consuming, and complex. Many educational professionals are involved with youths deemed to be at-risk (eg classroom teachers, learning support teachers, guidance officers). This course addresses a range of issues related to youth disadvantage, diversity and risk (eg socio-cultural factors: poverty, gender, and culture; school-related factors: disruptive behaviour, atentional difficulties, aggression; mental health issues: anxiety and depression, eating disorders, self-harm; and risk-taking behaviours: drug use, truancy, delinquency) that occur in the high school population. Skills in identification, assessment and management of specific problem issues are developed using a problem-based approach.",
