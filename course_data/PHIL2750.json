    "description": "Governments' 'economic' policies have a dramatic impact on people's income, wealth & employment prospects & so are of importance to most members of society. Rationally choosing from the enormous range of social & economic policies & reforms on offer involves weighing many arguments, very few of which are purely economic in nature. This course examines the essential moral components of these arguments. It examines different policies affecting the distribution of income, wealth & employment in society.\nThis course may not run if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.",
