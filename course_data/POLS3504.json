    "description": "This course will be offered as the Level 3 POLS3504 in 2014 and will move to the Level 2 POLS2504 from 2015. Students who commenced their program prior to 2014 and who wish to obtain credit for this course as a Level 3 should enrol in this course in 2014. From 2015 students who complete this course will obtain credit as a Level 2 course. Please note: the course Levels are not interchangeable \u00c2\u00bf if the course is completed as a Level 2 it cannot be credited as a Level 3.\nThis course aims to: (a) introduce students to the theoretical assumptions of conflict resolution; (b) identify how conflict resolution theory might be seen as an alternative to more traditional forms of dispute resolution at an international, national and intra-national level; and (c) develop an understanding of, and rudimentary skills in, the techniques of conflict resolution. The primary focus of the course will be on new and emerging issues in international conflict resolution.",
