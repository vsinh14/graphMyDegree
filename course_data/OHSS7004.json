Through a range of lectures, practicals and field visits, students will develop advanced skills for measuring and monitoring exposure to physical and biological hazards in the workplace. In addition students will acquire the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge to evaluate exposure information in respect to assessing and managing risk. The course focuses on key physical and biological health hazards including: lighting, noise and vibration, heat and cold, and ionising and non-ionising radiation. The course will also introduce students to emerging issues in occupational hygiene and explore exposure to psycho-social hazards.",
