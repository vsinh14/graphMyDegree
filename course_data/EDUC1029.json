    "description": "This course aims to stimulate students' thinking about key educational questions of why, what and how we educate with a particular focus on social justice. Students will consider these questions as an introduction to some of the foundations of the applied discipline of education. The course examines selected themes as these apply in the Australian context in order to challenge preconceived notions of schooling and education. The subject matter provides students with a framework on which to build an understanding of education as a discipline during their undergraduate years.",
