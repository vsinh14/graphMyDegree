    "description": "This course will cover the causes and effects of climate change and how, through informed environmental management responses, the risks that global warming presents to the environment and society can be effectively managed. The course will present the principles and practices of climate change risk and vulnerability assessment and climate change adaptation planning and evaluation, supported by effective stakeholder engagement practices. This course builds upon current knowledge of the causes and consequences of natural climate variability, and global warming induced by human activity using a wide range of examples from around the world. Policy development and implementation globally and in several national contexts will be examined in relation to both climate change adaptation and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Students will be challenged to articulate effective approaches to understanding and presenting climate change risk to environmental, social and economic assets, and development of environmental management responses that protect those assets and build resilience to globally and locally-induced impacts.",
