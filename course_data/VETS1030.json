    "description": "One Health represents the intersection between human medicine, veterinary/animal science, and ecosystems health. It refers to the complex interplay of infectious or toxic agent, various host species, and the environment in mediating the emergence and dissemination of disease. Although not a new idea, the One Health concept has been recently re-invigorated because of its value in understanding and controlling Emerging Infectious Diseases (i.e. Hendra virus or SARS). The majority of these diseases are zoonotic or involve animal interaction, so biological scientists and veterinarians play a key role in this process. However, a true One Health approach requires multi-disciplinary expertise, including sociological, agricultural, ecological and non-technical knowledge and skills. This course provides an introduction to One Health concepts and approaches.",
