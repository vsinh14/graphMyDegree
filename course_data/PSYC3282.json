    "description": "We all prepare food, play cooperative games, romance each other, etc. But how we do so depends on our cultural background - we are, by far, the world's most \"cultural animal\". So what was the 'X-factor', the magic ingredient of culture that took humans out of the general run of mammals and other highly social organisms? By emphasising research in developmental psychology and integrating perspectives from comparative, social and evolutionary psychology this course explores contemporary answers to this question.",
