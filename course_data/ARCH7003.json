    "description": "Students in this course operate on, in or alongside existing built fabric, analysing its heritage and material qualities, and formulating architectural proposals for its re-use, adaptation or conservation. The historical legacy of places is considered broadly, embracing the modern and industrial, cultural heritage and memorialisation as well as designated heritage sites. The design process takes in past and present uses of the site, as well as regulatory parameters, conservation policies and methodologies, stakeholders and economic viability. An expanded range of technologies, such as digital scanning, is used in the documentation of the site and the communication of proposed interventions. Students will be required to explain their interventions at a range of scales from the urban, to the interior and the architectural detail.",
