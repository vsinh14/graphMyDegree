    "description": "This course offers students the opportunity to consider some of the key ideas about sexuality and scandal in Europe, Australia, America and the Empire, from the Victorian period to the most recent past. This broad period saw concepts of sexuality radically redefined, with sexual constructions and sexual identities entirely reconcieved. The unit course also explore the ways sexuality intersects with other tropes, particularly race, class and gender. Students will gain an understanding of the concept of sexuality as an historical category and knowledge of the ways in which sexuality is relevant to the consideration of major intellectual, political and social developments in history. This will allow students to understand and appreciate sexual difference in the past, and also provide valuable critical tools for the study of sex in the present.",
