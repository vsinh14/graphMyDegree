    "description": "This course introduces students to key elements of social work practice across a wide variety of health contexts, including acute, primary and community health and non-government health-related contexts. The course adopts a lifespan approach to identify and discuss the health and practice issues for different population groups, and the personal, geographical, and cultural diversity of population groups. The learning activities in this Foundation course are designed to provide students with knowledge of the socio-political and theoretical contexts which frame social work practice in health, and with skills in basic assessment and intervention and professional communication. To maximise student learning experiences, the Health and Ageing Foundation engages social work practitioners in the design and delivery of workshops.",
