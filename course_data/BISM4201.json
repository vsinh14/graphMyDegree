    "description": "The application of business analytics can be the basis for competitive advantage; however, this advantage can be achieved only if the leadership of a firm appreciates the value of business analytics and appropriately manages the analytics capability of the firm. This course is designed with two objectives in mind. Firstly, the course aims to provide students of business analytics with an appreciation of how firms can organise to compete successfully on the basis of the analytics capability of the firm. Second, the later part of the course has a focus on cases studies in business analytics drawing from a range of applied business disciplines including finance, marketing, and supply chain management.",
