    "description": "The Business Model Innovation and Growth course is situated within the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Major and serves to equip students with knowledge and skills relevant to the post-start-up phase of the business lifecycle. Students will focus on two key themes: 1) stabilizing strategic and operational alignment around an innovative business model and 2) the scaling process and enabling growth through business model innovation. The Business Model Innovation and Growth course thus complements skills learnt previously in courses within the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Major which mainly focus on the start-up phase. More broadly, the Business Model Innovation and Growth course is relevant to anyone who is interested in getting a business to run well for target markets, be adaptable to new circumstances and put structure and systems into the firm for a growth phase. The course thus deals with the realities of day-to-day operations as well as their connection with a competitive strategy. Students also learn the pitfalls and promises of growth.",
