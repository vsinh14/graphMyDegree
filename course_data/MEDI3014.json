    "description": "The Medicine in Society course provides a unique opportunity for medical students to understand and experience the rewards, benefits and challenges of clinical practice amongst population groups and/or in communities that face access and equity challenges associated with health service delivery. \n\nSuch challenges can be attributed to contextual factors such as geographical isolation, ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status and/or life circumstance. Clinical practice within such a contextual framework requires a distinctive generalist knowledge, skills and attitudes. Whilst the context might be different, clinical practice is governed by a number of common parameters such as: isolation, professionally challenging, holistic patient care and team based case management.\n\nAt the core of student's learning experience will be a structured clinical placement where students will work closely with a Preceptor who will guide and support students as they provide health care in context.\n\nStudents will be required to undertake an Honours Research project (25%) and the core content for the Medicine in Society (pass stream) rotation (MEDI3013). The honours project will constitute a literature review, research question and oral presentation of research plan, methodology and data collection and finally a completed thesis.",
