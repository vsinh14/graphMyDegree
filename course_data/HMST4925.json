    "description": "In this course students are required to undertake an individual research project in the area of Human Movement Studies to gain further experience in research. The experiences should allow the student a greater understanding of the research process within Human Movement Studies and will normally be between 120 and 150 hours in duration.\n\nTopics and content are determined by student or staff initiatives and staff availability. Students are required to work with an appropriate academic staff supervisor. \n\nIt is possible for students to undertake individual research projects under the direction and guidance of individuals who are not academic staff members of the school of HMS. In these situations there must still be an academic staff member of the school of HMS to take a supervisor responsibility however the majority of the mentoring may be carried out by other approved individuals (e.g. post graduate research students, Sport Scientists from the QAS). The supervisor should liaise closely with the on-site supervisor to ensure progress is being made and assessment items are appropriately completed.",
