    "description": "This course takes students through the major macro issues relating to the modern world of international business. The course is about the world environment of business addressed at a global, national and regional level. It does not address specific firm management topics, but rather is complementary to those topics. The course looks at the modern concept of globalisation, its causes and effects, the increasing importance of world financial markets, the multinational enterprise and government policies affecting the internationalisation of business, and the likely future directions of world business in a global context. The course reviews the major economies of the world, their participation in the globalisation process and a range of economic multilateral institutions. Criticisms of globalisation are also discussed.",
