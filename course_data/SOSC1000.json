    "description": "Society, Challenges and Solutions is a multidisciplinary social science course with an applied approach to the study of human society. This course examines diverse aspects of social life from multiple perspectives, incorporating analytical and methodological strengths in a wide range of social science disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, political science, public policy, psychology and human geography. Through real cases of contemporary issues and social problems, students will explore a wide range of topics that shape both Australia and the world today - the changing nature of work and education, the environment and health, community and development. Using a blend of text, video, and online materials, students will learn the skills for independent study and collaborative investigation. Upon the successful completion of this course, students will gain critical knowledge on Australian and global social issues, relevant policies, and possible solutions. Through engaged peer learning, students will learn to think about and reflect on social issues based on evidence, develop proposals for action, and practice effective oral and written communication.",
