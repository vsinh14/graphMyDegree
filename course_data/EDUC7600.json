    "description": "This course introduces students to different approaches in education to develop a global understanding of the philosophies and issues that inform educational discourses worldwide. The course invites students to critically evaluate theories of education that have led to reform movements across the world, and provides pre-service teachers with a broad theoretical understanding of the role of education in society to support the skills development of concomitant teaching strategies. It critically reflects on major themes of contemporary education and their connections to social justice. In doing so, the course aims to prepare pre-service teachers for cognitive mastery of key educational principles and methods concerning the why, what, and how we educate with a particular focus on recent developments in social justice discourses. It challenges preconceived notions of schooling and education, including a consideration of appropriate learning and teaching practices for students with diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, with particular attention given to Indigenous students. The course offers the opportunity to investigate, analyse and synthesise important foundational, social, civic, legislative and ethical -knowledge for pre-service teachers entering the profession in the 21st century, which has seen unprecedented levels of diversity in schools, and invites them to generate and evaluate complex ideas and concepts for their professional practice and scholarship to engage all students in their classrooms.",
