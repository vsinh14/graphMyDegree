    "description": "This course provides background knowledge and practical experience in researching and designing an evidence-based health behaviour intervention with the potential to reduce risk of chronic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and major cancers). It is highly recommended that students have some prior knowledge of principles of epidemiology, for example, the MPH core course PUBH7600 Introduction to Epidemiology or an equivalent. Please note that PUBH7122 (in Semester 2) builds upon behavioural epidemiology skills covered in PUBH7123 therefore it is advisable to complete PUBH7123 before PUBH7122. This course may not be offered if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
