    "description": "The trafficking of human bodies (both living and dead) in the 21st century is a global trade with a long history. Whether people were born into slavery or captured and sold into slavery, women, children and men become involuntary commodities traded worldwide. Spanning the ancient world through to the present, this interdisciplinary course examines the changing conditions in which living and dead bodies are trafficked. It charts the conditions in which bonded labour and slavery, that is hereditary bondage, can occur. We contextualize these practices through an investigation of the changing cultural, religious, philosophical, social and economic justifications over time that have been used both to defend, and abolish the trafficking of bodies.",
