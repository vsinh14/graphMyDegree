    "description": "This is the culminating professional experience course in the Master of Teaching (Secondary) program and as such the end point is for preservice teachers to have achieved the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at a Graduate stage. Becoming a teacher requires commitment and dedication to both lifelong learning and personal autonomy. This 30-day block of professional experience demonstrates a movement along a developmental continuum where preservice teachers increasingly take on the roles and responsibilities of teachers to enter a phase of critical reflection and evaluation of their growth and development. This course focuses on the lifelong importance of professional learning to improve knowledge and practice and reinforces the critical need for ongoing engagement with colleagues, parents/carers and the community to build and foster supportive relationships. As this course contains a professional experience component in a school it is permission listed so that academic, preservice teacher risk assessment Blue Card status checks can be completed prior to enrolment.",
