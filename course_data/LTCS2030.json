    "description": "This course deals with the manner in which modern Japanese literature reflects issues of concern in Japanese society, among them family life, the ageing population, war, identity, gender and sexuality. Critical reading, against the grain of the translated text and \"unlearning\" of the unconsciously acquired preconceptions will be encouraged. The course aims to give an added dimension to the students' understanding of Japan through the study of the relationship of literature to society.\nThis course may be cancelled if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.",
