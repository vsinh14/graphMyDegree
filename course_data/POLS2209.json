We examine debates about the meaning of security in international relations and debates about the role, origins and changing nature of warfare in the international system. We then explore key global security dynamics ranging from the arms trade to nuclear proliferation, ethnic conflict and terrorism, and the contours of a new global security agenda in which we explore the relationship between security and poverty, disease and environmental change.",
