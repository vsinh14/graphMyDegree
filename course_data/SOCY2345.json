    "description": "Sociology involves the study of society in both its empirical and conceptual manifestations. In sociology there are a range of `big' ideas, key concepts and modes of knowledge that enable us to think about society. They range from ideas about the central dynamic of social relations (including social conflict, order and disorder), notions of social difference and hierarchy, the role of individuals and the self, and the position of non-humans. This course will explore, play with and critically examine some of these big ideas and how they help us to be engaged with social analysis and critique of our everyday social world and social institutions.",
