    "description": "(not offered in 2008) The course familiarises students with the concept of affective design & explores the idea of extending and supplementing usability by looking beyond functionality and performance to affect. Students consider advantages of taking into account users' emotional states & likely impacts of certain interface characteristics on mood and emotions. Attention then focuses on the media equation (the tendency to treat computers like real people/places) & different implications for affective design, with particular reference to computer game design, e-Learning, e-Health, e-Commerce etc.",
