The course will develop students' understanding of theoretical knowledge underpinning caring for older adults across a range of healthcare and community settings, and will develop clinical skills appropriate to caring for older adults, building on skills learned in semester one. Adopting a healthy ageing model, students will explore the physical, psychological and sociological theories of ageing. Students will develop knowledge around healthy ageing, common health issues for older adults and preventive strategies. They will examine the role of the registered nurse as a member of an interprofessional team, in supporting older adults and their significant others. Learning extends to legal and ethical principles associated with caring for older adults.",
