    "description": "This course provides an introduction to social work practice in the field of mental health. It will emphasize the importance of understanding the lived experience of mental illness and treatment as a starting point for practice, and focus on the use of relationship as a vehicle for change. Course content will cover theoretical and practical dimensions of practice including a critical exploration of mental health and the social impact that mental illness has on individuals, families and society. It explores the ways in which people with mental illness are marginalised and excluded within our society, and develops skills to link the personal experiences of people in the mental health system with social and political structures. Core skills developed are social work assessment, case management, working with families, working in teams, working in communities, and working in organizations. The course will be taught with extensive input from consumers and family carers.",
