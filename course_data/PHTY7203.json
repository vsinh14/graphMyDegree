A critical review of the construct of motor tasks and analysis of motor tasks when ageing/ neuro-motor dysfunction presents provides a basis from which task focussed management programs are developed. A rationale for the selection, proficient application of management strategies/ procedures and outcome measures that address dysfunction after brain injury and ageing processes is developed. A range of strategies in conjunction with task oriented training are presented and reviewed for evidence of efficacy to enable the optimal management of neurological or aged clients.",
