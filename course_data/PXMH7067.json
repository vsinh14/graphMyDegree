    "description": "This course provides students with basic training in preparation and planning to successfully undertake an independent research project. Students are required to formulate a research question, undertake a literature review and design and write up a research project. The size of the research project will be limited so that it can be completed in one semester. Students will receive intensive training in research design and participate in fortnightly group supervision throughout the duration of their projects. They also have access to a tutor who can provide advice as required. It is however expected that the student will demonstrate capacity to work independently.",
