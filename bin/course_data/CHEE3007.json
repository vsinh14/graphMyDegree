    "description": "Students completing a dual-major in Chemical and Environmental Engineering must complete either CIVL3150 or CHEE3007. Note that CHEE2501 is a recommended pre-requisite for CIVL3150. Only students enrolled in the Chemical / Environmental Engineering dual major are eligible for CIVL3150, students from all other Chemical Engineering plans must complete CHEE3007.\n\nMathematical process modelling for design, control & optimisation of process systems. Conservation principles, development of constitutive equations in models & analysis of resultant models for use in control & diagnosis of process faults. Model verification, calibration & validation based on process data is emphasised.",
