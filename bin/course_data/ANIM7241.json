    "description": "`Nutrigenomics' is the term used to describe the interface between the nutritional environment and genomic processes. The course provides a molecular understanding of how nutrients and bioactives affect productivity and health by altering patterns of gene expression. It also explores how genetic predisposition may influence the way an individual processes nutrients, opening up the possibility for personalised nutrition. A range of species will be used to illustrate the principles. Methods and data from a number of post-genomic technologies, including microarray gene expression platforms, SNP genotyping and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics will be explored.",
