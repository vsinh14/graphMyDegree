    "description": "Sport is a particular form of physical culture that is appealing to many young people. This course will consider the involvement of young people in sport and other forms of physical culture (such as hip-hop dance, surfing, skateboarding) with particular attention to such concepts as physicality, bodies, culture and identity. The course will take a globalized perspective of the phenomenon of physical culture and how it engages (or otherwise) youth around the world. Further, it will look at the sport-related policies at local, state, and federal government levels that seek to involve young people in the sporting culture with a view to fostering personal development, citizenship, and health.",
