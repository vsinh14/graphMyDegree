    "description": "The Australian Experience is designed to present a broad introductory survey to some of the key issues and themes relating to Australian society and culture across a wide time-frame. We begin before colonisation, with ancient Indigenous cultures, and end in the more recent past. Across this period, Australia underwent dramatic transformations in social, racial, cultural, economic and environmental terms. Throughout the course, we will gain an understanding of the brutalities of the colonial process; the relationships of the Europeans to this 'new' land; the developing society in the Antipodes; the new cultural forms of nationalism in the late nineteenth century; and finally to the importance of White Australia. In the twentieth century, we will consider the impact of wars and Depression, and the cultural shifts of liberation movements later in the century. \nThe course is designed to introduce students to some of the leading scholarship and debates in studies of Australian history, society and culture. While questions of gender, race and class are important organising themes, the course is also designed to engage with contemporary lines of critical inquiry such as questions of space, place and landscape, memory and historical imagination, identity politics, popular culture and post/colonialism. Our key focus is upon the many different and contested stories that make up our understanding of the national past, the intention being to convey its multi-layered and complex texture.",
