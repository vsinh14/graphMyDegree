    "description": "Collaborative water planning introduces students to participatory methods and evaluation frameworks relevant to water management and planning. This module extends knowledge of social science concepts and the application of social theories to real life scenarios. Planners agree that community input and participation should influence the development of a water resource plan or strategy and find that they need professional development in this area. Skills in fostering collaboration between organisations are also needed. \nTo foster a greater understanding of the role of collaborative approaches, this course will focus on when, and how these approaches are useful.",
