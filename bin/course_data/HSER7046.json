    "description": "Practitioners in the Social Work, Counselling and Human Services field can expect to interact with clients at the intersections between government and community, and at the individual, group, and organisational level. While this field of practice can encompass broadly different areas of social experience, it is likely to bring the practitioner into contact with people from differing ethnic and cultural groups. By canvassing topical issues relating to Australian Indigenous people, HSER7046 aims to prepare Human Service, Counselling and Social Work graduates to apply their knowledge appropriately and ethically as professional practitioners in this field.",
