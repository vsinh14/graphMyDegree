    "description": "This course will provide a critical overview of the history and formation of museums and their roles in contemporary society. It will examine the different contexts and perspectives through which museums can be understood, as institutional, civic and architectural spaces which display, study and house objects of historical, artistic, cultural, or scientific significance. The course will draw on case studies to critically explore museum practices, and issues relating to the politics of representation, the relationship between objects and meaning, museums and communities, as well as cultural rights, and the digital economy; before thinking about alternative models of museums and future challenges. The course involves a weekly lecture, as well as student presentations, and reading forums (in class and online), for which students are expected to prepare in advance for discussion.",
