    "description": "The primary objective of this course is to enable students to get a better understanding of community informatics, its applications in context, and its impact on development and social change. The course will specifically deal with the political and economic drivers that condition the uses of community informatics and will provide a broad overview of the affordances of community informatics. Using case studies of contested issues involving copyright, community-based approaches such as Rhizomatica in Mexico, internet governance, and e-government, the course will offer students an opportunity to understand the uses of community informatics by organisations, governments and activists, the larger politics of access and some of the key factors that either impede or facilitate the practice of community informatics.",
