    "description": "Teaching Health and Physical Education in Primary Schools introduces primary school preservice teachers to the teaching, curriculum and assessment principles and strategies of contemporary Health and Physical Education (HPE). The Australian Curriculum: HPE content material provides the context within which a range of teaching practices and strategies will be explored, particularly notions of integration and inquiry based learning. In this course preservice teachers will demonstrate application of knowledge and skills to plan, structure and sequence HPE learning goals and programs. Preservice teachers will engage in learning activities that develop their knowledge and use of teaching and assessment strategies that support student learning and inclusive participation. Within the context of these learning activities and assessment tasks, they will explore, use and critique a range of resources, including ICT, to enhance student engagement and achievement. This course introduces preservice teachers to HPE related policy and legislative requirements and provides opportunities to apply relevant strategies to ensure student safety and inclusive learning environments. Drawing on primary and secondary data, preservice teachers will further develop and employ a critical lens to confront key issues underpinning teachers' health work and school based health education. In particular, preservice teachers will explore the impact of their own biographies on the successful, sustainable and effective delivery of health education in school settings, including the health and wellbeing of teachers. A distinctive feature of this course is the engagement of preservice teachers in practical activities that develop their knowledge and skills in, through and about movement and physical activity.",
