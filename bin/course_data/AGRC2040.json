In both a classroom and field setting, this will include a bigger picture exploration of cropping zones in Australia, and move onto a \"ground up\" approach of crop production. Topics covered will include importance of healthy soils in sustainable production, tillage, crop selection and rotations, management of soil water and crop nutrition in rain-fed and irrigated farming systems as well as off-site impacts of agriculture. The course should provide students with a good foundation of the key factors driving crop production in cropping and mixed farming businesses.",
