    "description": "Entrepreneurship is commonly regarded as the pursuit of opportunity beyond the resources apparently to hand. With this maxim in mind, we explore the theory and practice of starting then growing new ventures, where opportunities exist but the pathways to unleash promising outcomes are uncertain. Knowledge and skill development is built by identifying and developing a new business idea within the class, through adaptive execution to generate information by building and testing business hypotheses so to navigate uncertainties. These skills are then used to analyse conditions across various entrepreneurial firms. Topics include the process of entrepreneurial logic, designing business models for value capture and delivery, framing competitive strategy, determining assumptions-based finance needs, understanding different innovation types and managing growth to build stronger ventures.",
