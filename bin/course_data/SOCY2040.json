    "description": "This course aims to introduce students to the sociological study of families. The structure and meaning of family life is changing throughout the world. A key focus of the course will be on identifying some of these changes and exploring their consequences for individuals and society at large. To that end, the course will introduce students to a number of contemporary social issues including cohabitation, same-sex marriage, fertility decline, unwanted childbearing, transnational family relationships, the links between paid work and family work, and family violence. Students will develop an understanding of the life-course perspective and other key theoretical perspectives relating to the scientific study of families.",
