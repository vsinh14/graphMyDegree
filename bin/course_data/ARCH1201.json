    "description": "Plan and Section: This course explores the significance of the plan and section in the design process and in the broader history of ideas. The capacity of sectional and planar strategies to determine formal and spatial solutions is tested in concert with programmatic and experiential aims. The reciprocal relationship between form and internal organisation is studied.\nIterative diagrams and orthographic drawings are the primary vehicle in this course for developing designs and communicating proposals.",
