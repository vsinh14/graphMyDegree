    "description": "Fisheries and aquaculture represent the largest source of dietary protein and are pivotal in current food\nsecurity. The science of sustainable management of these precious resources is therefore critical in the global grand challenge of sustainable future food security. This course provides advanced level content in the biology and mathematics of fisheries and aquaculture, including fish reproductive biology and dispersal, mathematical modeling and stock assessment, fish nutrition, health and genetics in aquaculture and fisheries. Students will produce a cohesive, evidence-based scientific discourse on the potential placement of fish and fisheries, both capture and aquaculture, in future global food security and poverty alleviation. For this they will draw extensively on the relevant biological sciences and mathematics and show adaptability and application in a changing economic and ecological framework. Excellent students should be able to demonstrate substantial unexpected extension in their critical analysis and thinking and in how they apply their in-depth knowledge and communicate it to a broader scientifically literate audience.",
