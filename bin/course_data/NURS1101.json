    "description": "This course introduces students to the psychosocial concepts of health, wellness and illness across the lifespan and the nurse's role in wellness promotion and population screening. Stages of the lifespan trajectory are introduced using a variety of theoretical frameworks that underpin transition, adaptation and resilience across the human lifespan. Students will identify how biopsychosocial and cultural factors influence lifespan development and how values, beliefs and attitudes affect perceptions of health and illness behaviours. Age and culturally appropriate communication strategies are pivotal to providing nursing care across the lifespan. Principles of communication will be woven throughout the course content. Public health policy and population screening strategies will be explored with students identifying fiscal limitations including sensitivity and specificity of screening and opportunities for health promotion. Students will develop theoretical understanding and health assessment skills focused on systems associated with reproduction, neurology and musculoskeletal across the life span.",
