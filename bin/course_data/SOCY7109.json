    "description": "This course draws on a range of social science perspectives to provide an understanding of the experience of health and illness in contemporary society. The course will demonstrate the ways that the financing of health care systems, the operation of markets, and social and political values and policies are highly consequential for how individuals and societies experience health and illness. We will examine various aspects of the social context of the politics, policy and funding of health care at the global level. In addition, we will examine various aspects of the social meaning of health and illness to further heighten our insights into medicine, markets and health today.",
