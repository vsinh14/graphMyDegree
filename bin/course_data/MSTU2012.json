    "description": "This course explores political and aesthetic trends in European film since the 1992 GATT treaty & the subsequent acknowledgement of the so-called \"cultural exception\" for international trade, that made it possible for European governments to keep subsidising their national audiovisual - including cinema - production as a protectionist measure against the indiscriminate import of Hollywood products. On the political side, the course studies the impact of EU policies in national industries, the boost of European co-productions fostered by the MEDIA & EURIMAGES funds, & institutional attempts to encourage the formation of a European cinema. On the aesthetic side, the course addresses two sets of issues: the profound renovation that some national cinemas have undergone in the 90s, especially in relation to the canonical post-war 'high' movements (gender, race, class); & the gradual creation of a recognisable 'European way' at several levels (genres, authorship, nationhood).\nThis course may be cancelled if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.\nThis course is taught biennially in semester two in odd numbered years.",
