    "description": "This course was previously offered as POLS2208. Students who commenced their program from 2014 should complete and obtain credit for this course as POLS3208. Please note: the course Levels are not interchangeable - if the course was completed as a Level 2 it cannot be credited as a Level 3.\nThe principal purpose of this course is to introduce students to the various theoretical approaches to the study of world politics. The subject matter of political theory - who gets what, when, where and how on a global scale - is open to a number of contrasting interpretations. The course therefore helps students critically engage with the ways in which ideas shape the practices of global politics. The course examines rival paradigms such as realism, liberalism, constructivism and feminism, as well as key concepts such as power, the international system, the state, anarchy, sovereignty, security, governance and norms.",
