This course provides a further introduction to school life through workshops and 10 days of school visits. Observation of practice will be provided to enable the opportunity for personal development and growth. Furthermore, practice in the design and implementation of lessons will also be a feature of this course. Therefore the focus of this course is on the development of lesson plans with further development of observation skills and understanding the importance of communication in a school context. This course is developmental and builds on EDUC1715 and provides a basis for the subsequent courses, EDUC2714, EDUC3714 and EDUC4714.
