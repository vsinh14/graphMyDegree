    "description": "30 days supervised practicum. The practicum provides opportunities for purposeful supervised experiences to develop pre-service teachers' understandings of themselves as teachers, the students they will teach, the contexts in which they will teach, and the teaching/learning process. During the practicum program, pre-service teachers will work with a range of learners with diverse needs and abilities, in a variety of social, cultural and geographical contexts. It represents a movement along a developmental continuum where students increasingly take on the roles and responsibilities of teachers to enter a phase of critical reflection and evaluation of their growth and development. From this course, students will be prepared to continue along the continuum of lifelong learning, engaging in professional learning to improve practice.",
