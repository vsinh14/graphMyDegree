    "description": "This course introduces basis generic concepts in comparative cultural studies, through consideration of how cultures are represented and experienced through paradigms created by other cultures. The areas covered by lecturers are quite diverse, ranging from the experience of Chinese and Japanese diaspora communities and the construction of Latin American identities to German-Australian relations and French constructions of the 'oriental' Other. However, the course aims to assert the unity existing amid such diversity by identifying generic issues of cross-cultural contact, transfer and (mis)representation.",
