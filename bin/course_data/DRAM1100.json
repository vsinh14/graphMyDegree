    "description": "DRAM1100 introduces students to the study of drama and performance, exploring both written and live texts. It examines theatre's special capacity to attract live audiences on the basis of its special effects and story-telling modes. We ask what attracted people to attend theatre across time, and what remains distinctive about the theatre experience today. Students learn about contemporary and historical performance from the perspective of reading, analysing, and performing play texts. Students will learn performance techniques in class, since tutorials include practical work, but we do not specifically teach or assess acting skills.",
