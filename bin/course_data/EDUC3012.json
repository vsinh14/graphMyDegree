    "description": "Queensland schools will begin the delivery of new high definition Senior (Years 11 -12) courses of study, in response to the introduction of high-stakes, external examinations and assessment accountability processes. As a result, the content and skills to be delivered to secondary school students in the subject areas of Senior Health and Senior Physical Education is substantially different from the previous low-definition courses of study. In response to these significant changes, EDUC3012 will provide students with interactive engagement with the innovative content, pedagogical and assessment strategies of these new courses. Authentic assessment tasks will build and provide evidence of HPE pre-service teachers' capacity to devise and deliver quality programs of Senior HPE in school settings.",
