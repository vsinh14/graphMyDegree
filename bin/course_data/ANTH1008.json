    "description": "Anthropologists are experts in human diversity. Anthropologists develop insights into how and why the infinite range of human experiences matter for understanding the world today. This course provides an introduction to anthropological approaches, focussing on questions of how humans make society and culture and why this matters. Topics include the culture concept, linguistic and symbolic communication, the limits of sociobiology, politics and the environment, religion, kinship, economics and magic. Research techniques central to anthropology are taught and assessed through practical work in listening, observing, participating and reflecting on social and cultural worlds.",
