It places the skills acquired in the language components of this program into their social & institutional context, by focusing on the structure & organisations within which translators & interpreters work. It gives students an understanding of the operation of various institutions in their political, economic, social & cultural setting in the respective country & region. The course also acquaints students with the terminology used in particular areas such as law, medical service, social security, industrial system, thus assisting in the development of specialised vocabularies for the different contexts of translation & interpreting.",
