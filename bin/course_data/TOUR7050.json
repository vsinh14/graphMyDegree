    "description": "The tourism and leisure industries are being increasingly fragmented into a series of niche or specialty travel forms of tourism that have emerged over recent years. Many tourists are now searching for novel and exciting types of experiences rather than opting for the traditional offerings cased in terms of passive engagement in industry driven and mass-produced, packaged products and services. The tourist of the 21st century is a savvy consumer who is motivated by a desire to indulge in new experiences across a range of diverse settings and has a desire for the authentic. Managers need to respond to these trends by understanding how to engage with tourists and to better design their services.",
