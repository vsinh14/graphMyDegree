    "description": "Literacy and numeracy are key enabling skills for full and effective participation in and beyond school life. Literate and numerate citizens contribute to the functioning of society and hence literacy and numeracy are a fundamental aspect of education. Literacy and numeracy practices are performed in a multitude of diverse contexts. The term `multiliteracies' acknowledges both the socially diverse (i.e., diverse languages, communication styles and socio-cultural contexts) and multimodal (i.e., any combination of these modes: oral, visual, audio, written, spatial, gestural, tactile) nature of literacy and numeracy practices in the twenty first century. Based on international and Australian research and theory, this course explores multiliteracies meaning making across the curricula, whilst embracing the participatory disposition of today's learners, who interpret, understand, use and create multimodal texts that, for example, incorporate images, video clips, sound effects, music, animation or more specialized representations (mathematical formulas, graphs and tables etc.). Research tells us that it is important to understand how various literacies and various cultural traditions combine these different modalities to make meanings that are more than the sum of what each could mean separately. National and international educational policy recognises both literacy and numeracy as essential foundational skills for success in all learning areas. Teaching strategies to build literacy and numeracy competence as general capabilities for personal enablement, civic and economic participation and social equity are the main focus of this course. \n\nThis course may not be offered internally if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
