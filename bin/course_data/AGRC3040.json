    "description": "Crop physiology provides a framework to allow you to analyse when, where and which crops to grow and how to maximise the productivity for the environmental constraints that exist. We need to understand how crops are limited by any type of stress, and what types of plant traits (characteristics) allow adaptation to that stress through agronomy and breeding. The basis of new scientific tools like crop simulation models and automated phenotyping (using robots and drones) are taught in this course, showing how crop physiology underlies research areas ranging from managing production risk through to modelling the effect of climate change on future production.",
