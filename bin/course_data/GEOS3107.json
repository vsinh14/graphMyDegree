    "description": "This course will examine how human activity and/or natural climatic variability has shaped the vegetated landscapes of the planet. Key aspects will include: Palaeoecological and archaeobotanical techniques; the relative role people and natural climatic variability played in ecosystem change; the geography of food, i.e. how and where our staple crops and livestock arose, their subsequent patterns of dispersal, and the environmental impacts of food production; and the impacts that future environmental change will have on vegetated landscapes. Case studies will be used to illustrate these topics from a variety of Australian and international contexts.",
