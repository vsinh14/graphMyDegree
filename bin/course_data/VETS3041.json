    "description": "This is an introduction to the reproductive technologies used to breed animals including livestock, laboratory animals, companion animals, and wildlife. Also covered is how some of these technologies are applied in human IVF clinics. Current concepts will be presented in assisted reproductive technologies including IVF (in vitro fertilization), animal cloning, stem cell technologies, embryo transfer, gamete cryopreservation, artificial insemination and genetic manipulation in animals. This will enable understanding of the role of artificial breeding techniques in animal breeding programs.",
