    "description": "Community Engagement for the Resources Sector explores a range of community development and community engagement domains, techniques and skills, as they apply to the context of the resources sector. It helps participants to develop an understanding of how workers in the community relations field in the resources sector can build on community development methods to develop specific projects and programs that build the capacity of the communities where mining occurs to the benefit of both the industry and the community. It focuses on how to assist communities and companies to move from activities to sustainable organised relationships and structures within the broader context of mining and development practice locally, nationally and globally.",
