    "description": "The Portfolio Remediation course comprises a tailored learning program undertaken in a work-integrated learning placement. The learning program will specifically address areas of weakness identified in the Year 4 Workplace Learning Porfolio, with the aim of attaining the required level of clinical competency across all eight components of the ePortfolio by completion of the course. Performance during the course will be managed through the UQ ePortfolio to enable students to monitor longitudinal clinical development and proactively manage their learning in response to feedback. A mid-semester review of the student\u00c2\u00bfs ePortfolio will facilitate revision of the learning plan and scaffolding of support strategies towards achievement of the required standard for progression.",
