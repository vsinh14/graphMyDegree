    "description": "This course provides a broad overview the diverse range of chemical risks encountered in the environment, which will allow students to better understand the public health implications of exposures to such hazards. This course will develop students' knowledge and multidisciplinary skills on how to assess and manage the risks posed by chemical exposures in an environmental health context. The risk from organic, inorganic and radioactive chemical that pose hazards through exposure via atmospheric, aqueous, food and other sources will be covered. Students will develop and refine their understanding of how and where exposures occur, how to calculate health risks associated with these exposures, and how to reduce risk through management strategies.",
