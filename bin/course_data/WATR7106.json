    "description": "In the management of the urban water cycle the environmental engineer is frequently required to address challenges that threat public health and environmental quality. This course aims to provide students with a framework for understanding emerging contaminations (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes, water born pathogens and nanoparticles) and their health effects in a broader water, health and environment nexus. Graduates will be positioned to understand the sources, occurrence, fate, and health effects of emerging contaminations in environmental settings (in particular in the water cycle). In addition to covering the basic concepts and principles of water and public health, the course will highlight various emerging challenges for public health and environmental quality, these will include: 1) antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria; 2) Legionella pneumophila in water supply systems and Legionnaires\u00c2\u00bf disease; 3) nanoparticles ecotoxicity; 4) pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs); 5) micro-plastics in environments; and 6) water contamination from firefighting foams.",
