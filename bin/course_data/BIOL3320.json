    "description": "This course will cover of all aspects of vertebrate evolution and diversity through space and time, delivered with a focus on Australian species. It will explore the main living and extinct vertebrate groups (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) with Australian examples, based on lectures and matching hands-on pracs. Subsequently, lectures and hands-on pracs will examine the basic body plan, diversity/ taxonomy/ ID, evolution, phylobiogeography, biomechanics (feeding and locomotion), and current topics of interest (such as conservation or biomedical relevance).",
