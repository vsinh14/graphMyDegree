    "description": "This course deals with the practices of modern governance. Governance can be defined as the tools, strategies and relationships used by governments to help govern. Interest in governance has in part been spurred by the view that governments should experiment more with `non-governmental' mechanisms in dealing with pressing problems, for example, through the use of market mechanisms, or by forging collaborative or partnership relationships with civil society or community organisations. A central argument in this course, however, is that the role of governments and state agencies remains central to governance strategies, and that governments have an important responsibility to oversee, steer, resource and render accountable all forms of governance. This notion of the `government of governance' can be termed `metagovernance'. \n\nThe course also deals with questions of knowledge and rationality in policy and governance systems and about how ideas and discourses shape the world of policy and governance. The course also explores the impact of power and institutional arrangements in shaping governance practices.",
