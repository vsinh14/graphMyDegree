    "description": "In this course, students will utilise the skills and methods they have learned throughout their linguistics major in exploring a family or geographical group of languages. The specific languages studied will vary from year to year, but may include groupings such as Australian languages, Romance languages, Afroasiatic languages, or Amerindian languages.\nStudents will explore the social and historical context in which the languages were and are spoken, basic descriptive overview of phonological, morphological, semantic, and syntactic systems, typological classification, and examine current issues in the linguistic analysis of these languages. In addition to the class discussions which will look at the languages as a group, each student will work in depth on a single language from the group, making use of published and other available resources on the language.",
