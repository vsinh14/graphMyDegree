    "description": "The concept of leadership is now widely understood neither as charismatic nor transactional. Instead authentic leaders who can transform organisations are desired by organisations as diverse as the armed forces and medical practice. Effective leaders need to be able to create missions and implement strategies that respond to longer term sustainability of the organisation as well as the society in which it operates and, ultimately, the very earth from which we sustain life. This course asks participants to continually reflect on their leadership capability in terms of wisdom principles of leadership that evolve throughout the course.",
