    "description": "Mediation is an effective way of resolving disputes and is now used in most Australian courts and tribunals. In some areas an extensive pre-litigation scheme exists and parties are required to attend mediation prior to commencing litigation. It is also used extensively in the resolution of community conflicts and in international peacemaking. In international and environmental areas, facilitators use mediation skills to assist the creation of innovative solutions. Increasingly, conflict resolution skills are required in management and business to effectively prevent, manage and resolve disputes and complaints. This interactive course was developed to meet the National Mediator Accreditation System (NMAS). Emphasising practical skills, students practice the theory of mediation by mediating and participating in a range of conflict role play simulations whilst receiving individual feedback on their style and overall performance by highly qualified practitioners. In the skills component, participants work with the mediation model and learn alternative approaches to deal with varying circumstances. This course has a quota of 27 enrolments.",
