    "description": "Great intellectual movements transcend disciplinary boundaries. They shift paradigms and revolutionize systems of thought. This course examines some of the most important intellectual movements in the humanities from Renaissance Humanism to feminism, postcolonialism and contemporary thinking about the post-human. It outlines their key concepts and locates them within their cultural and historical context. Through a study of selected interdisciplinary texts, students will acquire knowledge of the critical tools and insights that each movement developed and how to apply them. This course invites students to critically reflect upon societal values and appreciate the contingency implicit in many statements of cultural hegemony.",
