    "description": "The course explores in a thematic and theoretically integrated manner common issues of loss and grief that are inherent in many aspects of human functioning and adverse life events. As such it provides an example of an integrative approach to counselling. The influence of loss on reactions to a situation as well as approaches to intervention are considered. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to apply the knowledge gained to their personal experiences and work practices. The course aims to enhance the ability of practitioners to empower those dealing with loss through a) a knowledge of the literature around situations of loss including problems in grieving; b) the encouragement of individual, familial, community and system strengths, and c) the prevention of the escalation of problems associated with failure to address issues of loss and grief incumbent in a particular situation.",
