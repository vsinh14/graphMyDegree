    "description": "Soil Mechanics investigates the behaviour of soil under mechanic stress and deformation interacting with flow of water. This introductory course gives a first insight into the interesting world of soils. The course deals with: fundamental description of soils on the REV scale, the characterisation and the classification of soils; fundamental principles in the description of flow of water in porous media introducing the hydraulic head based on the equation of Bernoulli, determination of hydraulic conductivity and flow nets; fundamental mechanical concepts including the effective stress concept, strength of soils, consolidation, settlement and testing procedures.",
