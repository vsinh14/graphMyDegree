It focuses on maintenance of well-being from a perspective that considers the influence of systemic and economic factors on individual behaviour and well-being, and acknowledges the effects of gender, ethnicity, age, and other sociocultural factors on individual choice. It complements the individual focus of PSYC8111 Advanced Clinical Health Psychology. It uses lectures and discussion to provide in-depth knowledge and ethical and social understanding of the issues.",
