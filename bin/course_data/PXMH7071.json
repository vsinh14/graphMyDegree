    "description": "Group Psychotherapy has a strong evidence base as an effective\nmental health treatment that can be offered in conjunction with other psychological treatment or as an\nindependent treatment for mental health disorders. It is important for mental health practitioners to have an\nunderstanding of the potential for group interventions. The course will focus on core concepts of group\ndynamics and the use of group psychotherapy as both a stand-alone mental health intervention and as an\naddition to other mental health treatments. Evidence based and traditional group psychotherapy principles\nwill be explored and developed in practice to work effectively with a wide variety of mental health\npresentations. Students will develop skills in Group Analytic Psychotherapy, Group Cognitive Behavioural\nTherapy and Group approaches to Art Therapy.",
