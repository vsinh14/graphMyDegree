    "description": "This course addresses controversies over the principles and practice of social science research. It provides an overview of contrasting approaches to research in the social sciences, the foundations that underpin them and contestations over their claims to knowledge and truth. Trends in social research are reviewed with particular focus on debates over the design and value of cross-national and cross-cultural research and the potential to inform evidence-based policy. The overall aims are to sensitise students to the contested nature of social research and to produce critical consumers with the skills necessary for interpreting claims from social science.",
