    "description": "This online course aims to assist nursing students to develop comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the quality use of medicines and drug pharmacology in relation to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The course will cover aspects of the Australian healthcare system, focusing particularly on the National Medicines Policy and Quality Use of Medicines. Equitable, effective, safe, judicious and appropriate medicines usage will be discussed. The course will also cover pharmacological principles around drug pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination), pharmacodynamics, adverse drug reactions and drug interactions. Examples will be given from different classes of drugs and students will be encouraged to consider how relevant information can be considered within their own context and scope of practice. Students will develop critical skills around safe and effective drug use, prescribing and administration which they can then apply when making client care decisions.",
