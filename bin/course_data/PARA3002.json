    "description": "This course provides basic information about protozoan, helminth and arthropod parasites causing disease in animals and people. It covers: parasite morphology (fundamental to taxonomy); host range (species specificity); site of infection (tissue/organ tropism); parasite pathogenicity (disease potential); modes of transmission (spread of infections); differential diagnosis (detection of infections); and treatment and control (cure and prevention). Relevant technologies encompass population, organismal, cellular and molecular biology; and the course is relevant to students majoring in biological and microbial sciences, medicine, veterinary science, and biomedical research.",
