    "description": "Measurement is fundamental to both civilisation and science. In particular, the ability to evaluate people provides arguably one of the most challenging and yet potentially world-changing applications of measurement theory. This course will provide introductory training in the application of measurement techniques and principles required for research and practice in psychology. Diverse examples of practical applications of this knowledge within psychology and beyond will be provided in order to demonstrate its universal relevance. Topics that will be introduced include psychometric theory, measurement in behavioural research, competent and appropriate use of psychological tests, clinical neuropsychological assessment, personnel assessment, educational testing, intelligence testing, and personality testing. Students will receive hands-on training in how to create and validate their own behavioural measurement instrument. The aim of this course is to provide students with a foundation in how to apply measurement theory in their future careers, whether in the field of psychology or elsewhere.",
