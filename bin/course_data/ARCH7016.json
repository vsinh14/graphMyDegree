    "duration": "One Semester",
    "description": "Students in this course explore the potential of passive and active systems for the creation of architecture responsive to its social and environmental context. Design research includes environmental analysis, data extraction and evaluation, the impact of environmental factors on spatial quality and experimental strategies and systems for environmental control. Using traditional and experimental design tools, investigations span passive material-based systems reacting to environmental stimuli to computational media managing real-time data. Design proposals are expected to critically engage with architectural discourse to produce a project that exhibits detailed integration of conceptual endeavor and technical performance.",
