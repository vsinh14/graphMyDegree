    "description": "This course focuses on the centrality of politics in development. It examines contemporary development processes in relation to historical trends, and explores the ways in which local and global contexts are increasingly interconnected in an era of globalisation. The course introduces and engages competing approaches to development, and considers the politics and political implications of everyday lived experiences of development policy. Throughout the course, we closely examine the politics of social change, and consider the legacies of historical political change and their implications for contemporary development processes and challenges.",
