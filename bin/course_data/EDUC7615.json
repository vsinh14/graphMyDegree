    "description": "Through a 30-day block of professional experience this course provides a further introduction to the practice of teaching and demonstrates the ongoing importance of creativity, initiative and personal autonomy in teaching. The professional experience provides opportunities for purposeful and insightful supervised experiences to develop preservice teachers\u00c2\u00bf understandings of themselves as teachers, the students they will teach, the contexts in which they will teach and the teaching/learning process. Observation of practice will continue to provide preservice teachers with opportunities to critically reflect on and improve their own practice. Another feature of the course will be the ongoing practice in the design and implementation of units/lessons and assessment. This course is developmental and builds on EDUC7605, providing a basis for the subsequent course EDUC7625. The course will also incorporate and implement knowledge and skills developed across the Master of Teaching (Secondary) program so far. As this course contains a professional experience component in a school it is permission listed so that academic, preservice teacher risk assessment Blue Card status checks can be completed prior to enrolment.",
