    "description": "This course examines the actors and relationships in the Australian health system and the exchanges that take place between them. Health policy drives the system; how and why policy is created will be examined. The economic context in which health care is provided is examined and students develop the skills necessary to analyse issues relating to health systems from different perspectives. Policies and reforms initiatives in the Australian health system are used to illustrate the application of theoretical concepts. Students will have the opportunity to apply the principles learnt to current issues facing health systems and debate the alternatives.",
