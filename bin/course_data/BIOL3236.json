    "description": "Anthropogenic climate change presents a wide range of impacts and challenges for both the planet and the organisms that exist upon it. Drawing on a cross-section of fields from within the biological sciences, this course moves from our understanding, through paleontological evidence, of prehistoric climate change and its effects on our biota to current anthropogenic climate change and its potential consequences for individual organisms with regard to physiology, behaviour, population dynamics, and community effects. Students will also explore the challenges and uncertainties climate change present to scientists in terms of its potential impacts on terrestrial and marine species' distributions including infectious pathogens and their arthropod vectors.",
