    "description": "This course is the second in a series of two courses within the Masters of Teaching (Primary) degree that focus on the teaching and learning of Literacy and English. Three interrelated aspects of the teaching profession provide a developmental framework for the two courses: knowing yourself as a literacy/English teacher; knowing your students; and knowing the disciplinary content of the subject English as well as the place of literacy teaching and learning within other curriculum areas. In this course students will develop their role as a critical and reflective practitioner through participation in an online professional community of educators, expand their disciplinary knowledge of English and literacy, and prepare units of work that reflect current curriculum frameworks and policies as well as engage students from diverse backgrounds in intellectually challenging learning experiences.",
