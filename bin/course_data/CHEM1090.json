    "description": "This course introduces the core concepts and principles in chemistry at a foundation level that enables students who have not previously studied chemistry to progress further in tertiary chemistry. Concepts encountered include: atomic and electronic structure; bonding and molecular structure; intermolecular associations; states of matter; gas laws; solutions; equilibrium; acids & bases; thermochemistry; kinetics; redox processes; stoichiometry; and an introduction to organic chemistry. These are all considered in contexts that develop quantitative chemistry skills.",
