The course is designed as a key cohort experience for Bachelor of Environmental Management (Sustainable Development) students to explore a range of issues related to sustainable development and environmental management. The course provides an opportunity for students to explore and apply foundational concepts within this field of study (covered in courses such as ENVM1501, ENVM2100 and others), in an intensive and enriching environment. The study tour is based around themes, and students are encouraged to make connections across and between themes at a local and global scale. Additional fees are payable. In the event that students complete the fieldwork and then subsequently withdraw from this course without financial liability, the School reserves the right to charge full cost recovery for this fieldtrip.",
