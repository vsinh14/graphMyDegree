    "description": "This course engages pre-service teachers in an overview and analysis of recent developments in research about assessment. This will further pre-service teacher understanding about the relationship between assessment, reporting, planning, teaching and learning. Consideration will be given to a range of approaches to assess student learning, including the use of formative assessment to inform planning of effective learning sequences and the interpretation of student assessment data to inform and modify teaching and improve student outcomes. Pre-service teachers will be provided with opportunities to apply contemporary theory. Through a focus on strategies to support consistent and comparable assessment judgements, utilising criteria and standards rubrics linked to learning objectives and moderation processes, pre-service teachers will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to practice by identifying assessment strategies that inform planning and teaching. Strategies for providing feedback to students will be addressed. Pre-service teachers will also engage with a range of strategies for reporting to parents/carers and will investigate the value of and approaches to maintaining student records.",
