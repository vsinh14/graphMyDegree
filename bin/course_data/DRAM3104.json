    "description": "This course focuses on Secondments in Industry or an Individual Research Project. \n\nFor the Secondments you may have the opportunity to work with Queensland Theatre Company's Traction team, Metro Arts, the Brisbane Writers' Festival, or the Queensland Music Festival. Some students choose to pursue apprenticeships with Playlab, Queensland's leading script publisher and agency for the development of new work for the stage. In rarer instances, and by arrangement with individual companies based on students' areas of prior experience and expertise, the scheme can sometimes include secondments as assistants in administration, technical production, stage design, stage management, and marketing. Our company-in-residence, the Queensland Shakespeare Ensemble, provides excellent experience in these areas. Consideration for acceptance is on a case by case basis as the program is competitive.\n\nFor the Individual Research Project you will develop an extended 4,000 word research essay on a topic of the student's own choosing. This will be through consultation with the Course Coordinator.\n\nThe Internship application form is available here.\nThe Independent Research Project application form is available here.",
