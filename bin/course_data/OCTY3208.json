    "description": "Professional practice education is an integral part of the Occupational Therapy curriculum. Students will be provided with opportunities to build upon their earlier clinical coursework experiences and to expand their professional skills while learning to implement the roles and responsibilities of an occupational therapist within contemporary practice settings. Within these settings, they will also develop critical thinking skills in which students connect their clinical practice experiences to broader occupational therapy knowledge. Student professional practice placements will reflect the diversity of Occupational Therapy professional practice. Students may be allocated to placements within hospital or community-based services and these services may be in acute or long term settings within government or non-government organisations. During their professional practice placement courses students may work with people of various ages and stages of development across the life span. Students will be required to work in different models of service delivery which may involve direct service provision, case management, consultancy or project management or a mixture of these models of service delivery. Supervised practice education is an integral part of the occupational therapy curriculum. The World Federation of Occupational Therapy requires a minimum of 1000 hours of supervised professional practice education within an occupational therapy program for accreditation.",
