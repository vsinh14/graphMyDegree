    "description": "This foundational course is designed to encourage critical examination of key sociological issues within the context of\neducation. It will explore the structures of schooling that shape access to educational outcomes. It challenges\npreconceived notions of schooling and education, including a consideration of appropriate learning and teaching\npractices for students with diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, with particular\nattention given to Indigenous students. The course offers the opportunity to investigate, analyse and synthesise\nimportant foundational, social, civic, legislative and ethical knowledge for pre-service teachers entering the\nprofession in the 21st century, which has seen unprecedented levels of diversity in schools, and invites them to\ngenerate and evaluate complex ideas and concepts for their professional practice and scholarship to engage all\nstudents in their classrooms.",
