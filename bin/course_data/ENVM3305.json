    "description": "As mining activity intensifies, so do the impacts of mining and refining processes. The environmental impacts of these processes must be managed carefully to balance stakeholder expectations with financial costs to the mining company. This course provides an introduction to the management of environmental impacts associated with mining and refining activities. Through a combination of lectures, field trips, and practicals, students will learn how to: identify and mitigate potential environmental impacts during mining and refining processes; work collaboratively within a multidisciplinary team to create an environmental management plan; critically assess management plans and suggest improvements; and manage uncertainties (technology, expenses, stakeholder expectations) when developing management plans. Emphasis is placed on case studies to illustrate major themes of the course with real world examples.",
