    "description": "This course will give students an introduction to a broad range of laboratory animal models used in biomedical research, and a solid foundation in laboratory animal management, husbandry, experimental techniques and manipulations. Whilst emphasis will be given to classical animal models, the course will include the full range of experimental animal options, including genetically modified animals and non-mammalian species. The ethics and welfare implications of animal model use and confounders in experimental results will also be dealt with.",
