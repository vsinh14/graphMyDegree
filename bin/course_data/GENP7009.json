    "description": "#2 Sem 1 & 2, Web-based (+ one-day residental workshop)\nIn excess of 850,000 Australians have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with significant associated risks of micro- and macro- vascular disease. General Practitioners are increasingly seeing patients unable to be managed with oral agents alone and with complex renal, ocular and neuropathic co-orbidities. This course provides an overview of a best-practice approach to GP diabetes management including the selection of appropriate oral hypoglycaemics, the key management issues in commencing insulin in a community setting, and the assessment and management of all microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. As Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle related disease, maximal involvement from the patient in addressing key issues here is fundamental to optimal GP management. Students will be introduced to the skills and approaches GPs require to help their patients and communities to succeed in lifestyle review/modification, practice systems to maximise best practice management, chronic disease self management, recall and audit, and working effectively with secondary care. This course will include implementation of lifestyle intervention, including LifeScripts, in the practice environment. \nEducational processes: Online lectures, online tutorials with group discussions, face-to-face workshop.\n\nContact Hours (LTPCF)\nThe course will involve 26 contact hours: one third didactic learning (e.g. lecture), one third interactive learning (tutorial, seminar) and one third a practical skills group workshop. All learning will be web-based except workshop learning (held in Brisbane).",
