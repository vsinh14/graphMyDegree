    "description": "The purpose of the course is to explore community development approaches to local and regional economic development, with a particular focus on the communities and regions associated with the resources sector. Community Economic Development (CED) is attracting much attention both locally and internationally as an approach to revitalising local economies, creating employment, responding to globalisation and building strong local communities. But CED also means many different things to many different people. Therefore, for CED to fulfil any of these possible goals we must begin to understand what the different models, methods and processes of CED are, and how they have been/can be enacted in different contexts. This course explores both different practice models and different contexts of CED locally (i.e. within Australia) and internationally.",
