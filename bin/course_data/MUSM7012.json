    "description": "This course offers students the opportunity to engage with key issues in contemporary museology by conducting a semester long research project focused on a pressing theme, issue or problem germane to museums, and museum studies. The course will allow students to analyse and assess critically a museum, a museum collection, or museum as well as other areas related to collecting institutions, using the analytical skills they have acquired in other courses in the program. Students will be expected to conduct original research through the collection of data, data synthesis and written presentation of this data. Students will be required to submit their work in the form of a written report. It is anticipated that this research will involve visits to museums, galleries, and heritage institutions and liaison with relevant museum professionals. The course will give students the opportunity to develop research skills and methodologies vital to conducting a dissertation.",
