    "description": "This course critically examines the current importance of evidence for informing education policies and practices. Consideration is given to what constitutes evidence. Contemporary examples are critically examined, for example, the widespread use of testing data and comparative performance data within and across countries. The collection of and deployment of evidence to argue for change is considered by examining the complementary and conflicting interests of practitioners, scholars and decision makers. In particular the role of professional practitioners in generating evidence is considered in the context of the theory-practice relationship. Particular approaches to practitioner research, including action research and design research, are examined.\n\nThis course may not be offered internally if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
