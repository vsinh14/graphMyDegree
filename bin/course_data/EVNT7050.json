    "description": "The course examines issues and cornerstone theories that impact on international event planning, operations, marketing and resourcing. The complexities presented by (a) different markets, cultures and cultural settings, (b) different governments, policies and regulatory frameworks, and (c) different host countries/cities and public-private sector agencies and networks for optimising events tourism are a key focus in this course. Bidding strategies for international events, and the relationships and networks needed to organise and stage an international event, are also addressed. These topics provide a backdrop to the study of international event planning and logistics and global branding and marketing to attract inbound visitors, sponsors, exhibitors, performers and players.",
