Students will be directed to enrol in this course where appropriate by their Postgraduate Program Convenor.\nSemester 2 2018 course description - \nEvidence, Monitoring, and Evaluation in Peace and Development Practice.\nThis course brings theory and practice together in a hands-on approach to learning about the use of knowledge and evidence in peace and development interventions. Evidence, Monitoring, and Evaluation in Peace and Development Practice introduces students to the theory and practice of MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning) frameworks, from conventional approaches to complexity theory. Through this course, students will learn how to run a `theory of change\u00c2\u00bf workshop, write a Terms of Reference for an Evaluation and design a Monitoring and Evaluation framework. Taking a case study approach to learning, the course will draw on the expertise of practitioners and policy-makers in the field, including through guest lectures and expert interviews. The approach to learning will make the most of the time in the classroom by providing lecture videos, podcasts, audio materials, academic readings and case study materials prior to intensive workshops. In the workshops we will develop and practice the skills required to work in Evidence, Monitoring, and Evaluation in Peace and Development Practice, while equipping students with a critical understanding of the politics of knowledge in M&E.",
