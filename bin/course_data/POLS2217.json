    "description": "POLS2217 introduces students to the personalities, institutions and dynamics that have shaped European politics since 1945. Primary areas of study include the European Union (EU), domestic and foreign politics of major European powers (eg Britain, France, Germany and Russia) and the impact of specific challenges facing these countries (eg the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of Communism, German re-unification, civil war in former Yugoslavia, the US-led war on terror) on the willingness of European states to cooperate. With its focus on cooperation in the EU, the course not only enhances the student's empirical knowledge of contemporary European politics, but also of theories seeking to explain why sovereign states cooperate.",
