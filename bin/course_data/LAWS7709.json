    "description": "In every legal system, statutes are a main source of law and their interpretation is a central mode of legal reasoning, a mastery of which is essential to legal practice. This course reflects on how judges and others interpret statutes, and addresses key questions concerning the nature of sound statutory interpretation. Modern Statutory Interpretation is designed for lawyers with an interest in legislation as a distinctive type of law and in problems of interpretation. The course will consider the theory and practice of statutory interpretation especially throughout the common law world, with reference to Australian practice and examples where appropriate. Those who complete the course will be well placed to interpret statutes and to engage critically with the main modes of argument that characterise modern interpretive practice.",
