    "description": "This course provides a comprehensive overview of the ecology of rainforests globally, and a detailed exploration of the issues relevant to their conservation. By using rainforests as a case study, it is intended that students will gain insights into the conservation and restoration of threatened habitats generally. An integral component of the course is a week-long field trip framed around a quantification of the biodiversity values of old growth rainforest versus post-clearing regrowth and restoration. From this, students will produce an assessment item in the style of a consultant's report, emphasising the effective application of real-world skills in research, analysis and communication.",
