    "description": "The course is based around the theory of the firm which provides an explanation of how the firm fits into the economic system and creates value. The course relies on the paradigm of financial economics to provide an understanding of the broad range of determinants of firm value. These include accounting information which is generated for management purposes, particularly cost and value drivers, and external reporting, which considers the value effects of financial structures and control. Value created from the information systems environment in the firm is considered and the value effects of mergers, capital structure and distribution are also addressed. The course focuses on the role of governance in creating value and how ethics and reputational capital operate in a market economy. \nThe course relies heavily on case material and written and oral communications are emphasised as important outcomes from the course.",
