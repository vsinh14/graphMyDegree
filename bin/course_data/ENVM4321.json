    "description": "In the BEnvSc Honours year, participants choose and conduct an independent research project supervised by an academic advisor and possibly others from industry or government. This component of the BEnvSc program extends independence as a scientist and provides the skills to actively design, perform, analyse and communicate research and innovation. It prepares for entry into the workforce or a research higher degree (such as doctorate) by developing advanced skills. The components of the Honours assessment are identifying a research project and advisory team and developing a research proposal, conducting the research guided by the advisory team, and submitting a final research report, and presenting your work in a final seminar.",
