    "description": "This course sits within the Social Sciences and Entrepreneurship Major within the Masters of Entrepreneurship and Innovation. As such the course responds to calls that, in order to handle increasing complexity, leaders of the 21st century require vertical as well as lateral development. Lateral development involves building knowledge and skills in a technical area, in this case Entrepreneurship. Vertical development though is about fundamental and transformative personal changes to worldviews. Such transformative change is the focus of consciousness studies in leadership development theory and research. The course is based on constructive-developmental stage models of leadership development which have extensive empirical support. These models indicate that most leadership development programs develop leaders to a 'conventional' stage of consciousness whereas contemporary global problems require transition to higher 'post-conventional' stages. Empirical research also indicates what the contents need to be to facilitate such a transition. Therefore, the course responds to calls in leadership literature for more post-conventional leaders. The course thus fulfils the mission of The University of Queensland to develop global leaders based on deep personal awareness. The course will utilize empirically supported theories and methodologies to take students on a personally transformative experience measured by their increasing ability to handle multidimensional complexity. Students will find this course a deep personal experience and must be prepared to undertake inner change and introspection. The course may draw on a range of techniques to accomplish this including meditative and metacognitive where they learn to more closely observe their constructed beliefs. The course should not be undertaken by students uninterested in personal development or the exploration of techniques which take them beyond their present stage of consciousness.",
