    "description": "The objective of this course is to give the students the theoretical basis & practical skills in modern design of medium size digital systems in various technologies, with a focus on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design methodology, systematically introduced & used in the course, is based on simulation & synthesis with hardware description language (VHDL) tools. Topics covered in this course include: conceptual design step from requirements & specification to simulation & synthesis model in VHDL, design of complex controllers with Finite State Machines, design of sequential blocks with Controller-Datapath methodology, issues in design for testability, electrical & timing issues in logic and system design, overview of implementation technologies with emphasis on advances in FPGAs.",
