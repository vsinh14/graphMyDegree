The grammar covered will involve three categories: word, sentence and text level grammar, with a focus on these last two. A range of authentic written texts will be used to demonstrate the use of grammatical structures and their effects.\nNOTE: Course offering may be cancelled unless a minimum of 20 students enrol",
