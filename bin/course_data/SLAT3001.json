Students will develop a sensitive view of advantages and challenges that come with knowing two\nor more languages and cultures, and the way identity, power and language interact in bilingual and multilingual spaces. The\nstudents will also reflect on the way language development histories and socio\u00c2\u00bfpolitical contexts may affect language use and\nthe implications for maintaining individual and community bilingualism.",
