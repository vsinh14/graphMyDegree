It assumes that students have knowledge of principles of measurement and psychometrics and theories and techniques of selection in an occupational setting. The course pays particular attention to psychological testing (cognitive ability, personality, and vocational interests), and behavioural assessment (job interviewing, work samples, and multi-method strategies associated with assessment centres). It also explores contemporary issues in recruitment, selection, and appraisal that offer special challenges to the personnel practitioner.",
