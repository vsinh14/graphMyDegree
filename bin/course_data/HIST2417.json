    "description": "Great Britain's rise to global prominence after 1815 was marked by significant conflict, both internally and externally. Rapid industrial growth was accompanied by social tension, urbanisation and new forms of politics. Externally, the expansion of empire involved conquest, annexation, colonial settlement and the difficult business of imperial governance. Moments of crisis were frequent on both fronts. In this course we consider these broad trends and smaller episodes as key aspects of social, political and cultural history during the global rise and fall of British power. Key topics include popular radicalism, social reform, imperial ideologies, religion and morality, the crises of world war and economic depression.",
