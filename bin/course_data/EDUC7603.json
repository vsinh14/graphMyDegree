    "description": "This course engages pre-service teachers in an analysis of historical and recent developments in research that furthers our understandings of physical, social-emotional, and intellectual development. Critical knowledge and understanding of the science of learning, and the mind, drawing distinctions between psychological, biological and socio-cultural viewpoints, will be required. A particular focus of the course will be the developmental and contextual characteristics of students during early childhood, middle childhood and the adolescent years and how these may affect student learning and engagement. Pre-service teachers will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to practice by understanding the importance of the state of the learner for optimal learning and engagement. Consideration will be given to the importance of parent engagement in the educative process and strategies for maximising this engagement. This will include identifying strategies that are responsive to the learning strengths and needs of each student and that build a supportive, safe and inclusive educational environment.",
