    "description": "Compulsory Third Year Course (Capstone). This course examines theatre's engagement with themes of violence and conflict, and theatre's subsequent potential to affect its audiences viscerally. Moving backwards and forwards across theatre history, we trace our way though some of the most intriguing plays in the canon, touching on Greek theatre, Renaissance theatre, the nineteenth-century gothic, sensational melodramas, and contemporary iterations of murder, mayhem, and madness on stage, making the connections between certain tropes and approaches that have reoccurred or changed over time. Students will read accompanying critical theory and will have the opportunity to develop their own individual research projects. This course aims to deepen students' understanding of theatre history and historiography, while consolidating their research skills.",
