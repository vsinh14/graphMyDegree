    "description": "MIDW2004 is a clinical course which provides the foundation clinical skills and experiences in the Bachelor of Midwifery program. This course runs concurrently and is integrated with the theoretical courses MIDW2001, MIDW2002 and MIDW2005. Throughout the semester, clinical learning experiences will be planned to integrate with the theoretical concepts covered in the practice problems. Students will be rostered to attend clinical placement on either morning, afternoon or night shifts for 15 shifts of 8 hours duration. \nIn addition to their clinical placement, students will have planned clinical sessions in the laboratories in their base hospital with their Clinical Lecturer each week. In these sessions, they will learn specific skills that relate to their practice problems and which they may then implement under supervision in their clinical placement. Students will be assessed for competence within the clinical placement and maintain a portfolio of evidence in the acquisition of skill based competencies. Students will be required to complete 20 Continuity of Care experiences during the 3 years of their program and record their participation in these experiences in the electronic portfolio.",
