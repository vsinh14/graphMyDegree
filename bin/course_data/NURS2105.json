The course is situated in a primary healthcare framework and enables students to develop their theoretical knowledge and skills around health promotion, prevention, early intervention and the promotion of self-management in the context of chronic conditions. In addition, students will explore care planning, interprofessional teamwork, rehabilitative care and palliative care. The course content will be delivered over a 13 week period, utilising flipped classroom teaching approaches in clinical workshops, theoretical workshop sessions, online learning activities and self-directed learning.",
