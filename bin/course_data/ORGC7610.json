    "description": "Communication and Organisation is designed to give students a substantive understanding of major issues, topics and approaches to the academic study of organisational communication. It is structured around major themes in organisational communication research rather than specific topics in organisational communication. These themes include organisational structure, culture, networks, identity, change, power, and internal and external communication. A systematic study of these themes provides an understanding about how the climate and organisational culture shape organisational practices. Communication strategies for effective organisational practice and performance and the organisational structures that emerge to support these strategies are investigated and applied in organisational settings. The course will also explore some emerging themes in research such as contradiction, practice and communication flow.\n\nIn addition, the course takes a problem-centered approach, focusing on typical communication difficulties organisations experience. Case studies are used to learn how to effectively apply communication theory to actual organisational situations. It will explore a range of issues and topics, from gender, diversity and justice, to temporary labour, work-family issues, and corporate mergers.\nThe course is highly interactive, and students will be required to practice the skills they have learnt, and to critically reflect upon their experiences in relation to the skills and knowledge they have learned.",
