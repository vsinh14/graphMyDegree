    "description": "This course explores second language learning and teaching from the perspective of sociocultural theory (SCT). It introduces the central theories, principles and concepts of sociocultural approaches, which highlight the importance of context and collaborative relationships as mediating factors in second language learning, both inside and outside the classroom (e.g., online). Students will apply these concepts to their own and others' learning, develop materials, and analyse collaborative discourse drawing on SCT principles.",
