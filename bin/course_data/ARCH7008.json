    "units": "4",
    "duration": "One Semester",
    "description": "Students in this course experiment with emerging and known materials and fabrication technologies to address challenging conditions and programs. Prototyping, 1:1 resolution, digital fabrication and robotic assembly, prefabrication and lightweight structures are indicative topics addressed in these studios. A focus on innovation at the level of the detail will be a key driver for design speculation, approaching buildings as the aggregation of numerous decisions about material and assembly. Studio activities in this course are primarily undertaken through detailed material modelling and prototyping, along with computational analysis and drawing.This course utilises the Faculty's workshop facilities and maybe offered in an intensive mode.",
