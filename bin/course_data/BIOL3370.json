    "description": "This course will be first offered in Semester 1, 2017.This course will provide you with knowledge of the key principles and theories underpinning the relationships between animals and plants. It will cover animal-plant co-evolution, the key elements of animal-plant interactions (host selection, herbivore feeding behaviour and strategies, pollination biology), multi-trophic interactions and how these animal-plant interactions underpin much of the world's biodiversity. How these interactions affect animal and plant population dynamics and the management of pest and weed populations will also be covered.",
