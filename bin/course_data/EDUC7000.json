    "description": "This course explores the dilemmas facing, and risks for, young people growing up in the 21st century, with particular focus on the diversity of young people and the recent social, economic, cultural and technological changes affecting the lives of Australia's young people. Attention will be given to biological, cognitive, and psychological developments and the implications these have for identity formation. Particular issues such as mental health, sexuality, disability, substance use, employment prospects and the variations in young people's experiences will be addressed. A range of theoretical approaches to adolescent development will also be discussed. Students will examine how social agents such as family, peers, and community networks may help youth buffer the stresses of finding one's place in society and the relevance of transitional phases for intervening. This course may not be offered internally if the enrolment is less than 10 students.",
