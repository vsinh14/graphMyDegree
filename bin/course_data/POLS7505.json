    "description": "Peacebuilding is an extraordinarily complex cross-cultural international venture. Moreover, it has emerged only recently as a recognised domain of policy and risen rapidly into prominence. Drawing on scholarly writing, case studies and role plays, this course examines some of the elements that make up peacebuilding and explores some of the political, ethical and practical dilemmas that characterise efforts to rebuild the society and political community of others.",
