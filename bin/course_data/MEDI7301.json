    "description": "The eight week Surgery rotation is devoted to General Surgery (Breast / Endocrine, Upper Gastrointestinal, Hepatopancreatobiliary, Colorectal, Trauma & Acute surgery) and some subspecialties including Burns & Plastics, Urology, Vascular, Neurosurgery and Cardiothoracic Surgery. The aim of this course is to familiarise students with common, serious and life threatening surgical diseases and for the student to develop an understanding of how they present clinically; how to systematically evaluate these conditions; how they are investigated; principles of management; how to assess priorities for treatment; and when and how to initiate referral. The term is not intended to train students as technical surgeons but to develop students that are 'intern ready' who can function as part of a surgical team. Students will be allocated to surgical units, to participate in the daily activities of those units, and to participate in all that happens during their patients' episode of care. In addition, students should attend outpatients, ward rounds, operating theatre, and other unit meetings. In the individual teaching hospitals a tutorial program is conducted.",
