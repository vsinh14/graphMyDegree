    "description": "Genuinely new ideas usually need equally new and innovative business models to succeed. However, one of the biggest challenges in corporate innovation is that existing organisations tend to implement their best new ideas within their existing business model - which often causes the innovation to fail. This course is designed to teach students how to address this issue through working on real corporate innovation problems. The activities will include evaluating the problems addressed by a corporate innovation idea, validating the market opportunity, and developing an appropriate business model to use in launching the idea. Students will gain first-hand knowledge in some of the key corporate innovation issues such as: innovation portfolio management, opportunity identification and validation, and business model innovation.",
