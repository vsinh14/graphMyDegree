These interactions can be real or perceived, economic or aesthetic, social or political, and may encompass damages to the individual that result from wildlife legislation, regulations, or policies that are designed to protect or conserve wildlife, public benefits, and individual property rights. This course is about understanding the causes of and resolutions to human-wildlife conflicts.",
