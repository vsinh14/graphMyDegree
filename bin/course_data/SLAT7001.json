Students explore different methods of language teaching and learning, and analyse their own language learning in terms of these methods. A range of theoretical models of second language acquisition is examined and evaluated in relation to recent empirical findings, enabling students to develop the ability to think critically about findings in second language classroom research. The course also traces the evolution of the field of second language learning, focusing on developments in communicative approaches over the past twenty years, recent developments in teaching methodology and the use of technology in language teaching.",
