Students will work in teams to design and execute a strategic project for an industry partner. These projects will be drawn from industry partners in the corporate, not-for-profit, and startup sectors. Teams will work closely with their external clients to specify the scope of the project and then execute the design. While each project is different, they will all be of sufficient scale to incorporate the students' learning from across the MBA program - providing a unique opportunity to learn by doing.",
