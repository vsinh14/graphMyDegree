    "description": "The course introduces students to major emerging issues affecting policy and practice in the agricultural, agribusiness, food sciences and rural development fields, and equips them to apply their knowledge and skills in a rapidly changing world context. Topics include global megatrends, futuring and foresighting skills, leading into examination of globalisation, food security, climate change, water resources, sustainability and resilience. In combination with the leadership course, students will be encouraged to think of themselves as shaping the future, rather than solely responding to trends. The course will emphasise student directed learning, and case studies. The course will be designed to be equally relevant to students from developing and developed countries.",
