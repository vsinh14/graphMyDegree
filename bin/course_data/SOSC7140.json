    "description": "This course will provide students with interdisciplinary and critical perspectives on concepts, policies, and practices around questions of development effectiveness in the context of contemporary challenges such as climate change, rising inequality, and food insecurity. It focuses on how evidence and authoritative claims are produced, understood, and communicated in development (socially, politically, and methodologically). The course is shared by scholars from the Schools of Social Science, Political Science and International Studies, and Earth and Environmental Sciences to bring a collaborative and multi-disciplinary learning experience to students. It will introduce diverse approaches to effectiveness evaluation and teach introductory skills in logical framework analysis, impact assessment, gender analysis and development communications, and explore some of their limitations through hands-on exercises. This is a cross cutting course which will equip students with the interdisciplinary, critical skills and competencies to successfully analyse, navigate and evaluate contemporary development practice in Australia and the world.",
