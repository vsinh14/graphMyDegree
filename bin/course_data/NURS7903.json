    "description": "This course will provide students with the ability to develop advanced cardiovascular assessment skills and builds upon the knowledge gained in Fundamentals of Paediatric/Neonatal Speciality Care Course. Students will develop further knowledge of clinical interventions to support and manipulate cardiac output, including the use of inotropic and vasoactive agents, fluid management and respiratory support. Students will broaden their understanding of congenital cardiac conditions and the implications for pre-operative stabilisation and management. Impaired organ function is explored both as sequelae of impaired cardiovascular function and as primary diseases. In the later part of the course, students have the choice to further investigate one of three speciality areas including: post-operative paediatric cardiac surgical management, neonatal issues or general paediatrics including burns and oncology care. Students conclude this course by reviewing contemporary issues and practices in organ donation, transplantation and palliative care",
