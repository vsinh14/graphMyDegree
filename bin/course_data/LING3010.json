    "description": "This course is about how both social and cognitive phenomena affect how people structure information in situations of actual language use. More specifically, we will be exploring ways in which language structure is modified by both the conditions in which it is used, and by the nature of human cognition. Central to this course is how the demands of coherence in discourse affects the choices language users make with respect to language structure and how these choices may over time change the forms of linguistic structures themselves.\nThis course may be cancelled if there are fewer than 20 enrolments.",
