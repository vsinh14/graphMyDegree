    "description": "Peace and Conflict Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study with a commitment to the non-violent management and resolution of conflict from the local to the international level. To pursue this goal, core political concepts such as power, order, violence and justice are theorized in distinctive ways. This course develops an understanding of key theoretical approaches in peace and conflict studies research, and enables students to understand the relevance of theory to practice in this field. Students will engage in critical dialogue on questions such as how we identify actors in peace and in conflict, and how we can work against differing forms of violence and reconstitute just and participatory social and political order in the wake of violence.",
