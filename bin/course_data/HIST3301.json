The course will investigate the ideological, cultural, social, and economic causes of intense persecution, including but not limited to genocide according to strict legalistic definitions. It will examine the strategies that victims and perpetrators have used to cope at the time and afterwards with the moral issues involved. It will consider the special place of indigenous peoples in issues of persecution and genocide. Finally it will study international responses to genocide, and the contemporary tension between the principle of national sovereignty and `humanitarian intervention'.",
