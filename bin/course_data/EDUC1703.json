    "description": "As a teacher, a large portion of the day will be devoted to numeracy pursuits as a foundation for all other study. Numeracy as situated practice that requires more than basic skills is the focus of this course. Through this course, issues explored include the integration of numeracy within and through daily tasks, examining definitions of numeracy and what it means to be numerate, considering how technology has impacted upon numeracy learning and development, and exploring the skills, knowledges and understandings that a teacher of numeracy (at any level) needs to have.",
