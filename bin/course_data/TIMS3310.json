    "description": "This course sits within an Entrepreneurship and Innovation Major. As such the course responds to calls that, in order to handle increasing complexity, leaders of the 21st century require vertical as well as lateral development. Lateral development involves building knowledge and skills in a technical area, in this case Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Vertical development though is about fundamental and transformative personal changes to worldviews. Such transformative change is the focus of consciousness studies in leadership development theory and research. Research indicates that leaders develop their consciousness in stages with higher stages able to handle higher levels of complexity. These stages can include the leader shifting their central basis of operation in the world from egocentric to ethnocentric to worldcentric perspectives. The course thus fulfils the mission of the University of Queensland to develop global leaders based on deep personal awareness. The course will utilize empirically supported theories and methodologies to take students on a personally transformative experience measured by their increasing ability to handle multidimensional complexity. Students will find this course a deep personal experience and must be prepared to undertake inner change and introspection. The course may draw on a range of techniques to accomplish this including meditative and metacognitive where they learn to more closely observe their constructed beliefs. The course should not be undertaken by students uninterested in personal development or the exploration of techniques which take them beyond their present stage of consciousness.",
