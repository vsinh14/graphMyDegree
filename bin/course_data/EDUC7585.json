    "description": "This course will develop preservice teachers' understanding of Arts education in the primary years of schooling and their knowledge and skills in relation to content and appropriate teaching strategies associated with relevant Queensland and Australian Arts Curriculum. Grounded in theoretical understandings of the Arts as creative, aesthetic and embodied practice, this course explores philosophies and pedagogies which support learning and teaching in the five Arts strands: Dance, Drama, Music, Media Arts, and Visual Arts. Throughout this course, preservice teachers will be encouraged to develop their capacities and competencies as teachers, artists and researchers in the field of Arts education. This will be done by providing space for preservice teachers to explore Arts education as praxis (theory and practice). They will be presented with Arts education as interdisciplinary practice in specialist, generalist and integrated learning contexts. Particular attention will be given to engagement in Arts as a way to develop respect for, and knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages. This course will place emphasis on ensuring that preservice teachers are able to competently design, implement, assess and evaluate primary Arts programs in relation to the processes of: creating and making, exploring, and responding to, in the primary Arts Curriculum. Preservice teachers will be provided with opportunities to enhance their literacy and numeracy teaching strategies and application in the Arts Learning Area.",
