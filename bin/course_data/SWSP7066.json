    "description": "The primary purpose of this subject is to develop a critical awareness of the interaction between social work and the law in contemporary social work practice. The course explores some of the key legal principles and processes that underpin the Australian legal system and provides insight into how different areas of the law interact with and impact upon social work practice. Areas of law introduced include: human rights, child protection, domestic violence, substitute decision-making, mental health, administration, social security and criminal law. Aspects of law which impact directly upon social workers are also explored. Throughout the course there is a focus on students considering how the law applies in the type of situations they will encounter in their future practice, along with an emphasis on how social workers can enhance their practice and outcomes for clients by thoughtful application of legal principles and decision-making processes.",
