    "description": "This course provides students with foundational concepts and constructs in learning and development in organised sport settings. There is an emphasis on the central role of the coach in fostering learning and development. The course comprises two interrelated elements (a) psychological constructs and (b) understanding learning. Specifically, the psychology strand will use a 4C framework (Competence, Confidence, Connection, and Character) of Positive Youth Development (PYD) to know the athlete (learner) and the implications for coaching practice. This understanding of children and young people will contribute to an understanding of psycho-social development. The learning strand introduces students to understanding different views of learning and their application in a physical activity. There is consideration of all learners including the notions of inclusion and exclusion, sporting pathways, and diverse communities.",
