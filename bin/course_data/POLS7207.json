    "description": "This is a restricted entry course and requires prior approval from the School. The independent study option allows students of exceptional ability to engage in a minor research project. The course is particularly useful for postgraduate coursework students who wish to investigate a topic of interest not covered by other postgraduate courses. Prospective students must themselves identify and approach a potential supervisor and discuss their proposed research question; supervisors are not assigned by the School for this course. Student eligibility will be examined in the following areas:\n - Grade point average (GPA): successful applicants would be expected to have achieved a program GPA of 5.5 or better in their Masters program\n- Progression through degree : successful applicants would be expected to be in the final semester of their studies (or have completed at least #8 units in the program)\n- Viability of project : the project outline will be reviewed to determine its quality, viability and feasibility\n- Availability of supervisor : the research project must be of direct interest to an academic staff member within the school, who in turn must have the workload capacity to supervise a student. Further information, including the application form and application due dates, is available from https://polsis.uq.edu.au/student-support. Students are required to submit the application form and their independent study proposal by the relevant due date by email to polsis@uq.edu.au",
