    "description": "The lecture component of this course deals with the design of instruments and experiments and includes an exercise in designing an instrument to solve a particular problem. The laboratory component develops several important experimental techniques with a range of classical and modern experiments. In the laboratory students will: gain experience in advanced laboratory physics by carrying out a variety of experiments including an open-ended project style experiment; learn special techniques of experimental physics, including analogue feedback control; and further develop skills in writing scientific reports and maintaining laboratory notebooks.",
