    "description": "This course is intended to provide students with interest in the ecological, environmental, and agricultural fields with an understanding of the role of soil in plant growth. This course addresses the underlying mechanisms which control the interaction between plants and soil, rather than providing a purely descriptive account. Practical sessions and assignments provide opportunities to analyse soil characteristic and plant growth data. Key concepts covered in this course are the mechanisms through which soils supply water and nutrients to plants, the role of soil as an environmental buffer, and the essential processes carried out by the diverse microbial inhabitants of soils.",
