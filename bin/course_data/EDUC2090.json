    "description": "Australia can proudly make claim to having the world's oldest living cultures, knowledges and worldviews - those of Aboriginal peoples. This is the premise underpinning this course, where students are introduced to and engaged in aspects of both Australian Indigenous worldviews and knowledges to gain an understanding of how these have been maintained across time, spaces and events. The course is comprised of two Modules. Both incorporate the Domains of Teaching: Australian Professional Standards for Teachers: Professional Knowledge, Professional Practice and Professional Engagement. In Module 1, students are introduced to aspects of Australian Indigenous worldviews and knowledges and are engaged in applying these to their personal knowledge and experiences, and the expectations for their professional knowledge, practice and engagement. This attends to the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers 1: Know students and how they learn (specifically Standard 1.4: Strategies for teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students). \n\nIn Module 2 the focus is students' professional knowledge, principles for practice and engagement. This attends to the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers 2: Know the Content and how to teach it (specifically Standard 2.4: Understand and respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and promote reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians).",
