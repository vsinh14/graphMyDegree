    "description": "Evolution has shaped our environment, our bodies, and our behaviours to make us precisely what we are today. The battle of the sexes, the obesity epidemic, violence, deception, antibiotic resistance, the issues we see in the news every day, all make sense in light of our evolutionary history. In this course, you will be provided with the foundations of evolutionary concepts that will help you understand why these issues (and others) occur and if, or how, we can solve them. BIOL1100 will change the way you see the world around you, and give you a deeper understanding of human behaviour, food security and health in today's society.",
