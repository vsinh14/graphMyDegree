    "description": "The purpose of the Year 3 Medicine rotation is to provide an introduction to clinical medicine and therapeutics. The rotation is based upon placements in (mainly) general medicine units located in each Clinical School as a framework for clinical learning in medicine, coupled with clinical discussion sessions for each of the eight weeks of the rotation. The clinical discussion sessions will be co-ordinated by a consultant physician. In some cases a sub-specialist with a clinical interest in the topic of the week will be involved. The plan is for Year 3 students to continue to use their self-directed learning techniques and knowledge acquired during Years 1 and 2 of the MBBS to focus their learning within a hospital ward environment. Although core teaching time and subjects are uniform, each Clinical School will have some latitude to develop its own independent program.\n\nStudents will be required to undertake an Honours Research project (25%) and the core content for the Medicine (pass stream) rotation (MEDI3007). The honours project will constitute a literature review, research question and oral presentation of research plan, methodology and data collection and finally a completed thesis.",
