    "description": "This course prepares pre-service teachers to teach Choral and Instrumental Music in the secondary school. This course provides opportunities for pre-service teachers who are qualified to undertake a teaching area in Choral and/or Instrumental Music to build on the knowledge and skills developed in EDUC7645 Music: Curriculum Studies. The course will engage pre-service teachers in a critical analysis of recent disciplinary developments in scholarship and professional practice in the teaching of Choral and/or Instrumental Music. They will be provided with opportunities to develop the appropriate knowledge and teaching strategies to effectively deal with literacy and numeracy demands and learning opportunities that exist in Music Education. Pre-service teachers will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to practice through (i) designing, implementing and evaluating effective learning and teaching sequences and discipline specific assessment tasks that draw on curriculum, assessment, reporting, and ICT knowledge; and (ii) identifying and designing discipline specific opportunities for professional engagement and communication within the school context, teaching networks and the broader community. EDUC7645 Music: Curriculum Studies is a co-requisite for this course.\n\nThe course is relevant to the development of skills for teachers working within curriculum areas and those in the co-curricula arena. It should be considered as a complementary course to EDUC7645.",
