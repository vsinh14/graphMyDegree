    "description": "A comprehensive understanding of infectious agents and the host response to them is central to the safe practice of Dentistry. This course identifies relevant core concepts in Microbiology and Immunology, and will introduce the student to the characteristics and behaviour of infectious agents, and the functioning of the human immune system. Specifically, it will describe the essential elements of innate and adaptive immunity, their relationship to each other, and their responses to challenges with common pathogens. Topics will focus on infections (oral and non-oral) important in the practice of dentistry. Although a theoretical underpinning will be necessary for a full grasp of the topic, the emphasis will be on human studies and human disease, rather than the scientific experiments and discoveries that validate particular principles. The course aims to provide a firm foundation for the progressive development of the clinical aspects of both disciplines as students progress into third year.",
