    "description": "ARCS2010 will build understanding of the principles, evolution and sophistication of ancient technologies. Experimental archaeology is an important arm of archaeological research used to develop and test hypotheses about the practicalities, operational conditions and limitations of prehistoric technologies. The course will cover the anthropological theory of technology, the principles and objectives of experimental archaeological science, the origins and evolution of complex technology, and how technology can inform us about past human societies and cultural change. The course will introduce students to current systems of technological analysis in archaeology and archaeometry, including lithic and ceramic analysis, metallurgy, classification, and microscopic analysis of artefacts. The course includes hands-on experimentation with ancient technologies in weekly practicals.",
