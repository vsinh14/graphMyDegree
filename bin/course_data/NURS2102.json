    "description": "The aim of the course is to continue to develop students' foundational knowledge and skills related to professional nursing practice. The course will examine concepts related to delivering safe patient and person focused care to adults experiencing acute health care needs. The National Health priority Areas will guide the course structure. The course is a companion course to NURS2103 Clinical Practice 3 and builds on evidence-based practice approaches to delivering care to people with acute health care needs. There is an expectation that students continue to reflect on how their practice meets the NMBA Registered Nurse Standards for Practice. Students will have the opportunity through clinical simulation laboratory workshops to further their application of the person centred approach to nursing care. Students will consider the application of theoretical underpinnings as they practice extended clinical assessment skills, and learn nursing interventions including intravenous fluid and medication management; perioperative care; and mental health nursing care. The course content will be delivered over a 13 week period, utilising flipped classroom teaching approaches in clinical workshops, theoretical workshop sessions, online learning activities and self-directed learning.",
