    "description": "(no longer offered)This course provides an overview of Carbon Capture and Storage as an option for carbon reduction for low carbon power generation in Australia and round the world. The course takes a system view of CCS within a framework of policy, economic and technical considerations. Three key carbon capture technologies \u00c2\u00bf Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), Oxy-firing, Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) will be briefly discussed. The course will overview geological, terrestrial and biological Carbon Storage options, with a focus on industrial application. The issues related to carbon transport in long distance pipelines will be discussed and the inherent risks and opportunities involved in carbon capture and storage will be reviewed.",
