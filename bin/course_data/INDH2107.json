    "description": "This course engages with some of the main conceptual and practical issues that arise in working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, institutions and people.\n\nThe course also aims to develop practice skills, particularly in the important areas of cross-cultural understanding and communication. Some consideration is therefore given to the organisational contexts of practice, and how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are impacted by differing organisational and policy agendas. It examines a range of policy and social challenges in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australia, and discusses the implications of these for those working for and with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities.\n\nThe course affords students with an opportunity to reflect on their own cultural practice and on major theoretical and practical questions about cross-cultural workplaces raised by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous commentators. It closely examines historical and contemporary experiences of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities, and students develop skills that are responsive to the cross-cultural nature of their work.",
