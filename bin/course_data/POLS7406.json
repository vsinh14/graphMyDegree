    "description": "This course deals with the contributions of economic analysis to public policy and governance. The main rationale is to help students better understand how mainstream economists think and how they advise governments and other organisations involved in public policy and broader governance issues. After completing this course students should be able to more fully understand the language and major concepts of mainstream economic analysis as applied to governance and public policy. The course also engages in a critical evaluation of such contributions.",
