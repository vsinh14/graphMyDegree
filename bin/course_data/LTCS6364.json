    "description": "This course provides students with an opportunity to undertake intensive self-directed study of texts important to your chosen field of study. You will critically examine primary and secondary texts. Together with the course coordinator and/or a designated member of the teaching staff of the School of Languages and Comparative Cultural Studies, you will devise a reading program, report regularly on your learning, and undertake assessment tasks which will enable you to formulate a research project, understand academic conventions of referencing and help you to contextualise the chosen texts in the disciplinary field. The course is intended in large part to train students to identify a research question through the research process itself, and to understand the steps that would be required to bring that research project to fruition.",
