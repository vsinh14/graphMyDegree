Students will visit major archaeological sites and a range of important museums and collections selected by the course coordinator. There will also be associated lectures and information sessions. At the completion of this course, students will have a greater understanding of the ancient Mediterranean world and its history through to the present context. This experience will prove to be invaluable in any future studies within the Humanities which seek to foster an awareness of the European tradition to which the modern Australasian world is deeply indebted. This course may not run if there are insufficient enrolments.",
