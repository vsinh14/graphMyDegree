    "description": "The General Practice Rotation is 8 weeks in duration. The rotation is community-based and involves the use of general practices in the geographical region in which each student is based. It affords students the opportunity to see and participate in the delivery of health care to patients with a large range of biopsychosocial problems. Through exploring the community context of health and illness students will learn about people's experiences and everyday management of health and health problems, as well as some of the ways in which different community groups and organisations contribute to maintaining and promoting health in the community.\n\nStudents are encouraged to be enthusiastic and inquisitive, to become familiar with the everyday procedures involved in the workings of the general practice, and to function as a member of the health care team. Additionally, students are expected to use evidence based medicine skills to answer clinical questions as they arise, thus providing a benefit to the GP preceptors, as well as to their own learning. They are requested to work up illustrative cases to contribute at weekly small group, case based tutorials.",
