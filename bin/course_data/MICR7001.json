    "description": "Examines the positive (fermentation) and negative (spoilage) roles microbes play in foods and methods of preservation. Rapid detection methods and molecular (DNA) methods relevant to food microbiology including genomics, real-time PCR and culture-independent identification are investigated. It also explores the fields of probiotics, spores, biofilms and problems and applications of bacteriophages, GM microbes and bioreactors. Practical and tutorial components may include chemical preservation, yoghurt fermentation, the isolation and identification of food bacteria using PCR, DNA sequencing, bioinformatics and real-time PCR.",
