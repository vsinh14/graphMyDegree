    "description": "The Early Years Curriculum Foundations course focuses on key concepts that distinguish early years education. The early years of life are a time of extraordinary growth and development, as well being when children are introduced to group education and schooling. In these years, young people have vivid imaginations, creative ideas and energy and enthusiasm for life and learning. This course focuses on the importance of creating rich, engaging and stimulating learning environments that provide opportunities for young people to think, engage, explore and interact. We explore how carefully interwoven approaches to pedagogy, learning environments, relationships, and curricula cultivate young children's learning. Current rethinking and reconceptualising of early childhood education are embedded to apply ethical and political understandings to learning and teaching. The course will provoke you to question taken for granted practices in education, and provides ideas on how to engage learners (of all ages) in integrated authentic experiential learning, as well as navigate the complexities of national and state early years curricula guidelines. You are required to have a current blue card for participation in EDUC2704.",
