    "description": "This course focuses on the politics of global development processes. It examines the contemporary development constellation and explores the way in which local and global contexts are increasingly interconnected in an era of globalisation. We investigate the diverse actors involved in the development process, from local groups through NGOs, national development agencies, private actors, and multilateral institutions (such as the IMF and the World Bank), and consider the political implications of their interactions. The course traces the relevance of historical legacies and considers their implications for the changing political contexts of development in the 21st century. We examine regional experiences of development, as well as the way in which development in an era of globalisation is transforming national development experiences. The final part of the course is dedicated to examining contemporary development and poverty reduction approaches, such as the Millennium Development Goals and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper initiatives.",
