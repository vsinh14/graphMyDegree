    "description": "Intelligence is a subject of growing national and international importance. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, the role of intelligence in foreign and security policy has become more critical. Western governments (including Australia) have devoted considerable new resources to funding and reorganising intelligence agencies. This course will provide students with a deeper understanding of the role of intelligence in national security and will develop practical skills in aspects of intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination.",
