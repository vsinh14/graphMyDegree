    "description": "This course prepares pre-service teachers to teach Mathematics in the junior secondary school through intermediate levels of mathematics in the senior phase of schooling. The course will engage pre-service teachers in a critical analysis of recent disciplinary developments in scholarship and professional practice in the teaching of Mathematics. Students will become familiar with Australian Curriculum: Mathematics and how the curriculum documents are used to plan for and inform classroom practice. They will be provided with opportunities to develop relevant knowledge and teaching strategies to address literacy and numeracy demands and learning opportunities that exist in Mathematics. A focus of the course will be on interacting with and developing activities and learning experiences which engage and deepen student understanding of mathematics beyond the textbook. Pre-service teachers will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to practice through (i) designing, implementing and evaluating effective learning and teaching sequences and discipline specific assessment tasks that draw on curriculum, assessment, reporting, and ICT knowledge; and (ii) identifying and designing discipline specific opportunities for professional engagement and communication within the school context, teaching networks and the broader community.",
