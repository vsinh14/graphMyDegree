    "description": "Throughout the ages social movements have contributed to contesting the order of things. Social movements have appeared and disappeared, been tolerated or crushed, become popular or remained on the margins, and influenced society in the long run or merely created temporary change. This course will explore the differences between traditional and new social movements, the relationship between social movements and the media, and the role of communication in the democratisation process. The contribution and limitations of the media reform movements will be critically analysed, the major theoretical traditions of social movement theory will be explored, and students will gain an in-depth understanding of social movement theories in relation to examples from around the world. This course will be taught through case studies, interactive seminars, student led sessions, and analytical essays.",
