    "description": "This course will explore the history of Earth's life, from the dawn of the planet some 4.5 billion years ago, to the present. In ERTH2002: we will: examine the processes that can lead to the preservation of organic remains over geological time periods; explore key evolutionary and extinction events that have shaped the world around us; and investigate many of the ways in which we can make inferences about biological processes from the limited, often biased information preserved in the fossil record. Most importantly, you will gain a thorough understanding of the application of the fossil record to contemporary problems in the Earth and Biological Sciences. Content will be delivered in the form of 'contacts' where classes will include both theoretical and practical components. There are additional costs for the field trip.",
