In addition students are expected to incorporate and display UQ graduate attributes in their practice. During the preceptored clinical experiences in this course students will have an opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts learned in foundations of nursing practice in the previous two semester of the program, and to explore how research is best translated into practice. Students will be able to build on the knowledge and the interpersonal, clinical assessment and clinical intervention skills learned in the weekly clinical skills sessions in Clinical Nursing Practice 1 and 2. Students will have the opportunity to revise previously learned skills with either their clinical lecturer or their preceptor and will develop new skills as the opportunity arises.\nNB. Enrolment in this course in Summer Semester is by departmental consent - contact the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work for permission.",
