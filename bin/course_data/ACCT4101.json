    "description": "This integrative, capstone course is concerned with the interplay of accounting strategy and organisational policy and strategy making. How accounting strategy supports the achievement of the strategic ambitions of organisations is a particular focus. Key issues are establishing effective accounting strategies and the organisational and environmental precursors to developing such strategies. The distinction between financial and managerial accounting is given less emphasis; flexibility in the analysis of organisational opportunities is given more emphasis. Students are expected to show intellectual leadership by conducting a significant research project within the domain of accounting.",
