    "description": "This course will introduce students to some of the major themes in American history, with particular reference to the ways in which Hollywood has presented issues such as race, war, social and cultural change, liberty and the individual, and patriotism. As well as thinking about specific themes and events, and the ways in which they have been presented by filmmakers, students will be encouraged to reflect on the \u00c2\u00bfbig issues\u00c2\u00bf in United States history. The course will thus combine a chronological and thematic approach to explore a range of important issues that have shaped political, cultural, and social life in the United States. At appropriate moments, we will also consider the tensions arising from American foreign policy, as well as the global impact of American popular culture.",
