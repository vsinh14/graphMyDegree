    "description": "The course considers the main security challenges in the Asia-Pacific - military & non-traditional - focusing on major debates over policy responses to them. The Asia-Pacific is the world's most economically dynamic region. It is also one of the world's worst hot-spots for a host of security problems: the rise of China is challenging American primacy in the Asia-Pacific, a key fixture since the end of World War II; on the Korean Peninsula, the threat of nuclear war is very real; and the region's rapacious and rapid economic development has generated or exacerbated a wide range of non-traditional security problems, such as pandemics, climate change and environmental degradation. This course considers the main security challenges in the Asia-Pacific - both military and non-traditional - focusing on major debates over policy responses to them. It seeks to equip students with the capacities to analyse security problems in the region and provide relevant policy advice.",
