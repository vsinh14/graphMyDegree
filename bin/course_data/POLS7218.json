    "description": "Semester 2 2016 : China in a Changing World.\nAs a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and major world economy with extensive overseas development projects, China is an integral player in global efforts to address some of the most pressing security challenges in the world today. This course will critically examine China\u00c2\u00bfs international policies and diplomacy toward such issues as climate change, counter-terrorism, human rights, sustainable development and mass atrocities prevention. It will consider the key economic, political, social and normative factors that shape China\u00c2\u00bfs foreign policy and diplomacy on these issues, and examine the impact of China on broader efforts to strengthen institutional and collective response to new security challenges. By examining the complexity and nuance of China\u00c2\u00bfs position on a range on non-traditional security issues, the course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of China\u00c2\u00bfs global engagement in a changing world.\nSpecialist Studies in International Relations provides an opportunity for areas of study, not covered in other courses, to be offered under special circumstances (for example, a course to be given by a visiting lecturer in a specialty area that is not usually available). Regardless of changes in the content of the course, students can only take the course once. Please contact the Senior Administrative Officer (Academic) in the School of Political Science and International Studies for information on the current topic.",
