    "description": "This course examines public participation and community planning and policymaking. It will be of interest to students in the planning, policy, design, and environmental management fields. The course begins by asking: why involve the public in planning and policymaking? This leads to an examination of the politics of planning, the tension between local and professional knowledge in policy-making, and the many and varied understandings of \"community\". The course then considers the co-evolution of planning and public participation in national and international contexts.",
