    "description": "This course is an introduction to the several factors that shape the diverse cultures of Latin America, including the native peoples of the continent, the impact of European conquistadors and colonizers, the ideals of independence, and the contemporary continental order under the strong influence of the US. The course is organised around four modules: The Indigenous Pre-Hispanic World, Hispanic Heritage, Latin America in the 20th Century, and Brazil. Students should expect to get an overview of Latin American cultures throughout history, to gain a sound understanding of the ways in which Latin American peoples have represented themselves under different external influences, and to acquire a conceptual foundation for further study in the area of Latin American Studies. Students choose their essay topics from a list of topics related to each of the four modules in the course.",
