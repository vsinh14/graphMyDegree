    "description": "ENGL2405 is the cornerstone of the major and extended major in English Literature, so it builds on the introduction to literary texts you've received in the gateway course, ENGL1800. Here, we start to explore some more general ideas about how literary texts work: how they're constructed, what they do, the questions they raise, how they circulate and function, and the ways in which they're cultural and social phenomena. ENGL2405 will familiarize you with some of the main themes and currents of literary criticism and theory, and give you scope to explore issues of particular interest to you. It will also enrich any of the second-level courses you choose to do, and prepare you for the major's third-level options and capstone study.",
