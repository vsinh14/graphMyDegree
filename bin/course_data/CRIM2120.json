In this course students learn about the process of evidence-based crime policy development from the initial triggering event to translation into practice and evaluation. The course also gives students practical skills to recognise, assess, and generate evidence-based crime policies across a range of different crime and justice domains such as police, courts, corrections, and in related areas such as drug and alcohol treatment, corporations and crime prevention.",
