The course commences with an examination of the relevant legal history to construct a chronology of the recognition of the concept of Indian / Aboriginal / Maori and Native Title in the four common law jurisdictions. The course critically explores contemporary Indigenous titles, Indigenous policy and treaty making, Indigenous relationships with government. Developments in International Indigenous rights are introduced, including an examination of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The course then returns to Australia, to provide an in-depth examination of the native title legislation and critical Australian native title cases. It concludes with an examination of key contemporary issues in Native Title.",
