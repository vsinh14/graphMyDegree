Filled with uncountable gods and goddesses yet showing tendencies towards monotheism, manifold practices and beliefs contest and sometimes confound a unified conception of Hinduism. In exploring the roots of and key developments in the Hindu tradition, students will be introduced to its texts, conceptions of the divine, yoga, tantra and contemporary developments.",
