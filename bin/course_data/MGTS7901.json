    "description": "The course introduces future leaders working in healthcare contexts to a range of perspectives for understanding and addressing individual, group and organisational challenges around managing and leading people. The course provides foundational knowledge, skills and insights that can be built on by other courses on strategy, leadership, leading teams, marketing, and change management. The course develops management and leadership capabilities at two levels of analysis. At the individual level, the focus is on enhancing awareness of personal frameworks to develop individual performance (eg. motivation, learning styles, communication, and conflict resolution) and self-understanding (eg. individual differences, diversity, personality). At the organisational level, the focus is on developing knowledge and skills in applying frameworks for understanding and analysing organisations and their environments, and for solving organisational and societal problems.",
