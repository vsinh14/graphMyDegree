Enrolment is open to the first 40 students who enrol in this course on mySI-net.\nThis course provides participants with the opportunity to learn ways of developing effective therapeutic relationships in a range of helping situations. Students will explore and thoughtfully reflect on interpersonal processes and intervention strategies through lectures, discussion and experiential work. Particular attention will be paid to `big ideas' that have emerged from the practice and research of counselling and psychotherapy and how these apply to interpersonal work more generally. Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of the impact of their `use of self' in helping relationships and how this varies in different practice roles and contexts.",
