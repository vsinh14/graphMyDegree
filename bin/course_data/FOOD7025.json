    "description": "Functional foods are considered as those foods which are intended to be consumed as part of the normal diet but contain bioactive substances that offer the potential of enhanced health or reduced risk of disease. Nutraceuticals are concentrated forms of the food bioactives intended to be consumed as supplements in the form of tablets, capsules or liquid concentrates. Examples of functional foods include foods that contain specific fatty acids (e.g. omega 3) or dietary fibre (e.g. beta glucan), or biologically active substances such as phytochemicals or other antioxidants or probiotics with live beneficial cultures. Consumer awareness and interest in the relationship between diet and health has increased substantially and health is now a major driver for market positioning of foods. The course covers the issues and challenges in the development, evidence testing, marketing and changing regulations controlling functional foods and nutraceuticals. In this course students will develop an advanced knowledge of functional foods allowing them to form critical opinions of their efficacy and also about the currently increasing stringent health claim regulations within Australia and overseas.",
