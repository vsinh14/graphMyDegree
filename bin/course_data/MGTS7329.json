    "description": "This course is designed to convey the major principles relating to management across cultural and national boundaries. It focuses on interpersonal approaches between people of different cultures in work settings as opposed to a country specific approach. That is, the approach is used to understand the effect of culture in a way that can then be applied to a wide variety of cross-cultural interactions in a number of organisational context. Participants will interact, examine concepts, cases to increase awareness, and understanding concerning the influence of culture on management and management practices.",
