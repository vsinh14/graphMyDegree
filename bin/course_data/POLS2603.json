    "description": "This course explores the relevance of gender to the study of global politics. We approach gender as a complex and contested social construction that intersects with other axes of social identity to influence the way that we experience and understand the world. We examine how gender shapes and is shaped by the discourses, structures, and institutions of global politics, including those of development, health, the economy, human rights, war, peace, and colonialism. The course is designed to impart skills in gender analysis and to develop student capacity for independent research, critical thinking, and ethical reflexivity.",
