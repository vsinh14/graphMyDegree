A working knowledge of social research methods, including the capacity to choose the most appropriate methods to investigate particular research questions, to critically review social research, and to apply research findings to specific practice and policy contexts, is an essential component of social work practice.\nAfter completion of this course, students will demonstrate developing skills in critically reviewing existing research, building a repertoire of research and evaluation knowledge and skills. Students will be able to demonstrate skills in key approaches to social work research and evaluation including focus groups, analysing secondary data, qualitative analysis, and evaluation planning.\n\nThis course is for students in the Bachelor of Social Work and is a requirement for Honours.",
