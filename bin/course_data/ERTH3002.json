    "description": "\"The best geologist is [the one] who has seen the most rocks.\" (H. H. Read, 1940). This field trip will give students the opportunity to visit classic locations where type examples of geological processes and products otherwise unable for study locally are best seen. The course will involve an introductory workshop and reading but the major focus will be on the field trip itself. This is likely to be to a remote field location associated with a major plate boundary or other first order geological phenomenon. Students will participate in field exercises and class discussion and produce a final report at the end of the trip. Additional fees payable. Please contact the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences for additional information.",
