    "description": "This course provides students with an opportunity to explore the complexities and challenges of modern plant breeding. The course will cover the foundations of cultivar development through the application of cross breeding and selection, coupled with a range of advanced breeding technologies that are used in the development of breeding schemes leading to the release of improved plant varieties and cultivars. This will be examined in the context of population improvement and the development of inbred, hybrid, synthetic and clonal cultivars. Case studies and simulations will be used to highlight recent advances in plant breeding research, examine the impacts of gene action, heritability and genotype x environment interactions on the outcomes from breeding and selection.",
