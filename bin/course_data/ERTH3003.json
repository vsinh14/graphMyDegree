    "description": "Geomicrobiological processes recorded in the Earth record and bacteria-mineral interactions in contemporary systems will be examined, including phenotypic methods for the analysis of prokaryotes, the factors affecting their community structure and function, and their relationship to geochemistry and mineralogy. Principles of inorganic geochemistry including an introduction to thermodynamics; applications of geochemistry and geomicrobiology to ore-forming processes, weathering and subsurface microbiology, e.g., acid mine drainage environments. ERTH3003 is strongly recommended for Geological Science majors, Environmental Microbiologists and Environmental Science majors.",
