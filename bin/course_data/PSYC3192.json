    "description": "The sensation of seeing, hearing, touching or smelling is a product of activity in your brain. Scientists who wanted to work out how this activity could generate conscious perceptual experiences established experimental Psychology as a discipline. In this course we will appraise contemporary evidence concerning these links. Students will be taught how to critically appraise empirical evidence, establish research hypotheses, and how to test those hypotheses.",
