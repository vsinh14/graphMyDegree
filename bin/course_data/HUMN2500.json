    "description": "A central feature of work today and into the future is collaboration. Real world challenges are most effectively addressed through understanding different perspectives and forms of knowledge, and proactively cooperating with others in working towards solutions. Collaboration is thus fundamental to human society as through doing things together we not only address these real world challenges, but also build our sense of community and individual well-being. The aim of this course is to examine the processes that are fundamental to collaborating effectively across the humanities and social sciences and beyond.",
