    "description": "Water, Sustainability and Development introduces students to current theory and practice of sustainable development and poverty alleviation, and its application to Integrated Water Management. On completion of the module, you will be able to employ a range of analytical frameworks for understanding the links between water, poverty, gender, power and livelihoods. You will be able to plan and facilitate community consultations and participatory workshops, build governance capability in community-based organisations, and negotiate collaborations across a range of stakeholders. We maintain a strong emphasis on applying analytical frameworks to case studies of actual practice, including sustainable livelihoods framework, gender analysis frameworks, vulnerability and capacity analysis, complex adaptive systems, political economy analysis, and collective impact. By maintaining a case study and problem focus, we draw out the inherently political processes of community participation, deliberation, social learning, and stakeholder and conflict management. We take a participatory learning approach, which places a high value on the knowledge, experience, skills and attitudes that you bring, and tries to find ways to enable you to share them with others.",
