The practicum provides opportunities for purposeful supervised experiences to develop pre-service teachers' understandings of themselves as teachers, the students they will teach, the contexts in which they will teach, and the teaching/learning process. During the practicum program, pre-service teachers will learn to work with a range of learners with diverse needs and abilities, in a variety of social, cultural and geographical contexts. It represents the beginning of a developmental continuum where students increasingly take on the roles and responsibilities of teachers.",
