    "description": "The purpose of the Business Psychology Projects are to develop the skills required to work both as an internal and external consultant in the private, public and not-for-profit sector. Each student gets to work on a mix of projects covering different areas of practice and work settings. Types of settings may include small consultancy firms, large consultancy firms, publicly listed companies, government agencies, not-for-profit organisations, and independent practice. The projects are challenging, and require students to apply their skills to a wide range of complex problems. Projects typically involve a mix of internships and externships. During an internship, students work as a group on a consultancy project for a real client under the supervision of an experienced consultant. During an externship, students work in, or for, an external organisation.",
