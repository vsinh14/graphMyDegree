    "description": "This course will examine a topic in Greek history, or Greek culture more broadly, in a manner designed to foster research skills in students. There will be a stronger emphasis on historiographical features of relevant texts than in ANCH courses at 1000- and 2000-level, and students will be expected to display greater independence of thought and an advanced capacity for self-management in comparison to lower-level courses. The course will attempt to move beyond earlier scholarship and to suggest possibilities for future research that might be tackled independently or collaboratively, in a variety of written forms.",
