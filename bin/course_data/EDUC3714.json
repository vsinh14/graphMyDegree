This course provides a further introduction to teaching through workshops and a 20-day block practicum. Observation of practice will enable the opportunity for personal development and growth. Practice in the design and implementation of units/lessons will also feature. The course focusses on the relationship between the professional standards explicated by the Queensland College of Teachers and the work of a teacher. This course is developmental and builds on EDUC1715, EDUC2712 and EDUC2714, providing a basis for the subsequent course, EDUC4714.
