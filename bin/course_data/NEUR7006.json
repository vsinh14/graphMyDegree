    "description": "Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience is concerned with cell and molecular biology of the neuron. Advanced treatment of the following specific topics will be given by selected research experts: cytology of the neuron; synthesis and trafficking of neuronal proteins; ion channels; G-Protein receptors; synaptic transmission; trans-synaptic signalling; modulation of synaptic transmission; and molecular pathological processes underlying neural disorders. \nStudents who do this course will be given an up-to-date understanding of how the nervous system works at its most fundamental level. It will also provide the latest knowledge on our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of some key nervous system disorders.",
