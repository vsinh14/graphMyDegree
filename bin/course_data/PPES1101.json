    "description": "This course examines the development of political, philosophical and economic ideas and their interaction before the existence of today's disciplines of Political Science, Philosophy, and Economics. Key ideas studied include \"the state\", \"happiness\", and \"the market\". By adopting a historical approach to the development of these ideas and their domestication in rival academic disciplines, the course equips students with the ability to see where intellectual specialisation has been beneficial, and where it has hindered the analysis of social phenomena.",
