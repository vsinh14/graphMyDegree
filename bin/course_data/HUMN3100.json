    "description": "Problems of our time that seem almost insurmountable need radically new ways of thinking through solutions. Big problems need big ideas and creative thinking that absorbs the breadth of current intellectual endeavour. The ideas and attitudes of artists, writers, and thinkers, both past and present, frequently constitute the groundwork of major social, political, and cultural debates;indeed, help shape what we think of as ultimate, \"meaning of life\" questions. This course examines how researchers and practitioners in the Humanities help to shape new thinking about some of the most pressing issues confronting our time, and in the past: the planetary ecological crisis; ethnic, national, and religious conflict; the politics of identity; and problems of justice, equality, freedom, and good government.",
