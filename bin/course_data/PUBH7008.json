    "description": "#2 Sem 1 Inc: GHSP7109 or SM881 Qualitative research methods are increasingly being applied to health evaluation and research to answer questions which conventional quantitative methods have found difficult to address. This course considers in some detail the basis of qualitative methods in the social sciences applied to health. It examines the differences between the main paradigms and how these are applied to answer research questions. The second part of the course invites learning about methods and skills in qualitative methods. Among the techniques considered are content analysis, group interviews, in-depth interviews, and direct and participant observation. Issues such as sampling, data gathering, ethics, analysis and reporting are also addressed in relation to qualitative research.",
