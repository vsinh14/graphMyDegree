It will explore the latest research in the field, how this can be translated into the various teaching, learning and leading contexts relevant to the participants, and will encourage discussion and reflection on how participants individually think about and support learning and teaching. Students will develop skills in the critical evaluation of Science of Learning literature and how to translate this into practical applications for teaching, learning and/ or leading. The course will be highly interactive with some of the content determined by the participants. Participants will be challenged to articulate through a variety of mediums how this research impacts their thinking and their practice, and will collaboratively develop a set of Learning, Teaching and Leading Principles exemplified through the course content and delivery.
