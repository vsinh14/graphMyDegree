    "description": "Effective research and written communication skills are vital in heritage management, including professional consulting, policy development and in regulatory contexts. Students will research and report on an independent project in heritage management, typically incorporating new observations to address a defined research problem. Students will develop a project with staff, closely aligned to that staff member's area of research interest. Following data collection, the final written thesis will follow a specified format and include a full exposition of the results and their significance in respect of the research problem and the existing state of knowledge. Students will also present their project design, including rationale and method, to their peers and staff.",
