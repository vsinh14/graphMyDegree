    "description": "This course is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skill base necessary for effective entry-level mental health social work practice. Assessment and content have been devised in consultation with experienced social workers in the field. SWSP4183 has a skills focus and engages directly with some of the most challenging and confronting areas of practice such as suicide risk assessment and the administration of the Mental Status Examination. To this end it is important to note that the course will regularly confront students with discussions of sudden death, psychosis, trauma and child sexual abuse. It is scarcely possible to practise in the field without encountering these issues and part of the experience of studying SWSP4183 will be the need for students to develop individual ways of coping with stressful content. Please note also that the skills focus of the course will require students to engage regularly in role-play activities.\nDespite all this, SWSP4183 has consistently received strong feedback from students as a safe, supportive environment in which to develop the skills necessary for effective practise in mental health. This year will be no exception!",
