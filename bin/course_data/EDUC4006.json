    "description": "Students will engage in the process and skills of conducting high quality research in health, sport and physical education. Students will produce a range of research-oriented products that reflect their journey of learning as they proceed through the steps of the research process. During this course, students will work individually and in teams to develop a research idea from conception and presentation of a research proposal to collection of small data sets for analysis and presentation at a culminating student-led mini-conference. Students draw on the curriculum concepts, theories, issues and practices, their own and others' research introduced in earlier courses, and recent professional experiences to address the research hot topics associated with the field of health, sport and physical education. In so doing, these future leaders of the HPE profession will gain an understanding of, and capacity to conduct, the vital research that underpins innovative curriculum practice within and beyond their school contexts.",
