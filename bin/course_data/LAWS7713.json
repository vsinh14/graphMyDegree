    "description": "After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the prevention and prosecution of terrorism emerged as a key priority for governments. This subject considers and critiques Australia's approach to fighting terrorism, with a particular focus on the positive and negative human rights implications of anti-terrorism law. Students will be introduced to key aspects of Australian anti-terrorism law, situated within a theoretical and comparative context. Core themes of central importance in the national security arena emerge in this discussion. For instance, how far should governments go in protecting national security? How might basic values like democracy and the rule of law be preserved in the national security context? Does a tension necessarily exist between the preservation of national security and human rights? How might governments seek to achieve security and liberty? What roles are played by the judiciary and legislature as checks upon executive overreach? How might the effectiveness and necessity of anti-terrorism measures be tested and achieved?",
