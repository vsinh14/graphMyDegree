    "description": "There are approximately 70,000 described fungal species in the world out of what has been estimated to be a total of between 1-5 and 5 million species. In Australia possibly less than 10% have been described. Fungi exist as saprophytes, pathogens, endophytes and mutualistic symbionts. Along with algae they form lichens and with plants they form the all-important mycorrhizae, particularly essential for plants growing in nutrient depleted soils. Fungi cause 80% of plant diseases in agricultural crops, occasionally leading to crop failure where past incidences have led to humanitarian problems and other major social consequences. They are essential components in drug discovery and pharmaceutical production; most of the current antibiotics have been derived from fungal processes. Industrial uses such as the production of citric acid are dependent on fungal fermentation; the yeasts, essential components in alcohol fermentation and baking, are also fungi. However, as a Kingdom, a higher Kingdom within the Eukaryotes, fungi are often overlooked. This course aims to promote the Kingdom Fungi. You will learn about their classification using both traditional and molecular techniques. You will investigate the environments that you find fungi in and study the role that fungi play in those environments. Fungi are essential in the breakdown of cellulose and lignin so without them the decay and essential recycling would not occur. We will look at some of the industrial and medical applications as well as the nastier side of fungi where they cause disease in plants and animals including humans.",
