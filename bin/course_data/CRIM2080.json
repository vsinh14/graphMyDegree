    "description": "This course will examine a number of current and emerging threats that challenge the global security of nation states. Topics to be examined include global security threats arising from terrorism, extreme environmental events, organised crime and cyber crime. Throughout the course these security threats will be studied in-depth through an examination of specific trends and case studies to better understand the level of risk they present to countries like Australia. Policy responses will also be canvassed with a focus on the prevention of global security threats and the regulation of processes and behaviours that give rise to them.",
