    "description": "This course provides a broad introduction to the fields of management and public health and their application in Indigenous Australia from the perspective of promoting self-determination in health. The course explores the historical, social and political context of current Indigenous health status. To gain a deeper understanding of the complex factors that impact on Indigenous people the course explores a number of other dimensions. It looks at how the health care system operates in terms of health service delivery (to individuals, families and communities), in terms of policy developments that impact on service delivery and in terms of funding that pays for service delivery.",
