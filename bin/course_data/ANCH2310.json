    "description": "This course will examine the relationship between powerful individuals and the Roman state during the period of the Republic. From a situation in which state power was shared, so that the state was a `public matter\u00c2\u00bf or `public business\u00c2\u00bf (res publica), Rome eventually fell under the control of emperors, who were kings in all but name. How did this happen? How vulnerable or resilient was the idea of the Roman state as a res publica throughout this process?",
