    "description": "In the coming decade, how the Australian Health System operates will be the major issue of Australian political and public debate. This course examines three fundamental questions: Why is it a major challenge to sustain the Australian health system? Why healthcare leaders will need to rethink workforce planning? What are some current solutions on offer? In this course, you will learn to understand and to discuss with confidence the most important features of the Australian healthcare system. This means not only being able to understand the structure and arrive at your own answers to the above questions, but also to analyse significant policies, players, debates, and ideas informing current health system planning. A key objective of this course is to use this knowledge to reflect on your own management style and workplace practices, to understand where your organisation fits in with `the system\u00c2\u00bf, and to learn to decipher important policy patterns and trends in public health practice. You will have a clearer understanding of the factors and influences shaping the future of the Australian Health System.",
