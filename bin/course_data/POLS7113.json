It evaluates different methodological approaches used in the comparison of policies between and within countries, and critically assesses the potential for policy transfer. Selected policy areas of current or ongoing concern in contemporary political systems are used to illustrate the types of lessons that can be drawn from comparison. The course equips students with the ability to critically evaluate comparative policy studies and to engage effectively in current debates over policy directions.",
