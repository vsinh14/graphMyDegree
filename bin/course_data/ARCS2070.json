    "description": "This course prepares students for the identification and analysis of human skeletal material excavated at archaeological sites. Students will become familiar with human osteology and skeletal evidence of ancient disease and trauma (palaeopathology). This information is placed in the context of major developments in the human past (eg. changing cultural approaches to death and burial, human migration, social stratification, the development of agriculture and animal domestication, urbanism, colonialism, conflict, and the development of medical treatment). Cultural approaches to death and burial in the archaeological record are explored, as well as the natural and artificial preservation of soft tissues (mummification). Site conditions that lead to bone preservation or break-down are also discussed. Scientific methods used to image, identify and analyse ancient diseases are used increasingly in archaeology, and these are discussed in detail. In addition, this course covers ethical considerations relating to the excavation, analysis, display and repatriation of ancient human remains.",
