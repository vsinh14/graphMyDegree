In addition students are expected to incorporate and display UQ graduate attributes in their practice. During the preceptored clinical experiences in this course students will have an opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts learned in the foundations of nursing practice in the first year of the program and in their elective clinical placement. Students will be able to build on the knowledge and the interpersonal, clinical assessment and clinical intervention skills learned in the weekly clinical skills sessions planned in Clinical Practice 1 and 2, and in their elective clincial placement. Students will have the opportunity to revise previously learned skills with either their clinical lecturer or their preceptor and will develop new skills as the opportunity arises in their practice setting.",
