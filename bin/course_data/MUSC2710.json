    "description": "Music's power and influence in human affairs spans an ethical spectrum ranging from the promotion of benevolence to the incitement of malevolence. Its role is strongly felt, yet poorly understood, partly due to the perceived barrier of music notation, not to mention its apparently self-referential structural logic, and abstract, non-representational character.\n\nThis course aims to provide students, regardless of musical background, with the aural skills, musical vocabulary, and analytical tools to describe and talk about how music works both within people, and throughout societies beset by conflict. By illuminating how music affects material contexts, this course will reveal the role music has played - and continues to play - in perpetuating conflict, protesting conflict and injustice, and peacebuilding. The course revolves around close listening to diverse musical examples from history and around the globe, with related readings deepening understanding of the historical, cultural and political contexts the music arises from, interacts with, and effects change within.\n\nPlease note that this course offering may be cancelled if fewer than 10 students enrol.",
