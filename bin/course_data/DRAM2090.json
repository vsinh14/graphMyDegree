    "description": "This course offers students the opportunity to study the origins of Western theatre in the drama of Ancient Greece and Rome. The course will provide students with a detailed knowledge of the social and economic organisation of these classical cultures in order to better appreciate the centrality of live theatre performance to the city states of Athens and Rome. We will explore theatre architecture, genre and cross-cultural influences between these two major civilisations in order to provide students with a rigorous working knowledge of this vital foundation of the western theatre canon. Students will then be encouraged to engage with theatre that references, reinterprets or adapts this classical theatre in order to read contemporary theatre practice from a more deeply informed knowledge base.",
