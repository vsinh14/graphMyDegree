    "description": "A remote delivery (distance education) course that brings together basic anatomy and physiology and relates this to behaviour. The main body systems will be examined sequentially and aspects of biology relevant to currently active or promising research areas featured. The course features aspects of physiology and anatomy that are relevant to the status of insects as pests and beneficial organsims and as developmental model organisms. Class discussions of relevant topics are encouraged and assessed. Recorded mini-lectures accompany web-based resources.",
