    "description": "This course gives students flexibility to study in depth topics which are not covered directly by other formal courses. In general, there are no lectures and hence no timetable for them, but will require self-directed study with the student having to formulate a topic, retrieve information, structure and write the assignments. There will be three assignments and the topics will be in the area of food science and technology. The student will agree on the topics after consultation with the course coordinator or another academic staff member in a specific area in some instances. A list of possible topics will be provided to the student.",
