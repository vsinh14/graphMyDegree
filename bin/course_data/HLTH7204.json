    "description": "Clinical teaching and learning skills are integral components of professional nursing and midwifery practice. However the context and the nature of the clinical teaching experience requires different approaches which will be influenced by the learning needs of the individual consumer, colleague or student. This core course will prepare nurses and midwives for educational leadership roles within their own specified area of practice; enable them to educate, support and develop their colleagues; provide health education to their clients and support beginning practitioners entering their profession. This course may not be offered internally if the enrolment is less than 8 students.",
