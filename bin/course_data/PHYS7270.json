    "description": "This course covers advanced numerical simulation techniques used in computational physics and their application to several physical problems. Topics covered include the solution of few-body classical dynamics, quantum mechanical eigenproblems, Monte Carlo techniques, the Metropolis algorithm, and classical models of magnetism. The course will cover some topics in advanced C++ programming, including floating point numbers, vectorisation, optimisation, parallelisation, and debugging techniques. The course requires the use of C++, and this will be introduced from scratch.o cover some topics in advanced MATLAB programming, including vectorization, optimization, and debugging techniques.",
