The course is structured using an action-learning approach. Students work in teams on a series of case studies throughout the semester under the supervision and guidance of an experienced consultant. This involves assessing the needs of the client, defining the scope of the project, developing a project plan (including milestones and deliverables), developing a budget, preparing the proposal or tender, and making a pitch to the client.",
