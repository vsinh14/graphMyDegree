    "description": "Communication for social change is an emerging frontier, the goal of which is to use communication processes, techniques and media to facilitate social, economic and technological development. In this course students will be introduced to the traditions of employing communications for social change, to the factors that influence theory and practice, to new and evolving approaches to communication for social change, and to the ethical and moral basis of the differing communication traditions. A key concept explored is the consistency between development paradigms and communication traditions, particularly related to theories of modernisation, dependency, and participatory communication. This course will be taught through case studies, interactive seminars, student led sessions, and analytical essays.",
