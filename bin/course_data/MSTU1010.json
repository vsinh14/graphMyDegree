The course examines a range of approaches to creativity including the `mythical', `psychological', `social', 'cultural' and `environmental. Students are challenged to consider the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'how' of creativity, and the ways in which these considerations apply to their own thought and practice, individually and collectively.",
