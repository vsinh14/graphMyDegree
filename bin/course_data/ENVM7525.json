    "description": "This course provides an advanced level analysis of the issues that businesses face as a result of increasing constraints on the use of 'carbon'. These issues include how businesses can adapt to different operating cost structures, including the increasing costs of fossil fuels, the costs arising from a mandatory emissions trading scheme and the costs of implementing new technology. Issues associated with how businesses can participate in activities that contribute to climate change mitigation, such as emissions monitoring and management, are also analysed. The course also discusses some of the strategic opportunities businesses have to achieve competitive advantage in a carbon constrained environment.",
