    "description": "Traditionally applied psychological research has focused on understanding the causes of psychopathology & the evaluation of therapies aimed at alleviating psychological distress. In more recent times attention has broadened to consider psychological well being as an important focus for applied psychologists. The field of positive psychology acknowledges that people maybe be \"languishing\" but not suffering from traditional mental disorders such as anxiety or depression. Importantly, this focus on positivity has attempted to identify a wide range of character strengths and virtues that promote creativity, cognitive flexibility, a sense of purpose or more generally promotes \"flourishing\". This course will explore both the theory & practice of positive psychology.",
