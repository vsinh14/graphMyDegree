    "description": "Why are errors caused in healthcare settings? What can be done to eliminate them? Who, ultimately, has responsibility for these mistakes? What are some tools and techniques that prevent future errors occurring? With the rise of Patient-Centred healthcare, Australian healthcare leaders are under constant pressure to articulate clearly and confidently policies and procedures on Patient Safety and Quality. The pressure arises not only from concern for the patient, but also from the substantial personal and organisational risks associated with lapses in Patient Safety and Quality. In a nutshell, problems with Patient Safety and Quality policies and practices expose health leaders to increased risk of litigation, loss of reputation, and damaged staff morale. This course faces these issues head on. You will learn about key theories on Patient Safety and Quality. You will learn tools, techniques, and procedures to build stronger policies and frameworks for error prevention. You will learn specific approaches to understanding variation, types of errors, and means of collecting data on errors. By the end of the course, you will be able to speak articulately to other leaders, managers, and employees on health care issues, and have a sound knowledge base to prevent future errors in healthcare in your organisation.",
