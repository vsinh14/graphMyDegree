    "description": "This course introduces students to the interaction design challenges of building physical computing environments. Physical computing tehnology mediates people's embodied interactions in order to gather input and present output through a combination of various sensor and display technologies. Following a studio process, students engage in collaborative design activities to understand a problem space; explore alternative solutions, leading to a cogent technology proposal; and deliver an interactive proof of concept prototype tool or environment combining appropriate digital and physical components.",
