    "description": "Students participating in the group-supervised thesis will work in a group, focusing on different aspects of a common research project, to create an independent research thesis. Participation in all steps involved in research, including the formulation of research questions, study design, data collection, and data analysis, will be required. The research question must be developed within the constraints offered by the common group project. Outside of the lectures and tutorials, students will work independently to collect and analyse data in order to test their research question. When possible according to the needs of the research project, lectures will focus on practical skills required for successful research and practice in psychology. Students will be assessed on the independent research thesis that they will write throughout the course.",
