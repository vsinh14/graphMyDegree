    "description": "This course is presented in two elements. The first element looks at characteristics displayed by effective leaders. It provides an insight into the participant's leadership style and the impact this style will likely have on others, as well as suggesting methods to build on the participant's strengths and contain limitations. Furthermore, it provides a capacity to better understand the people that participants will lead-their motivations, values and personal circumstances.\nThe second element relates to project coordination. Project coordination is the charting of a clear path towards achieving a goal. This element aims to demystify the art of project management by explaining the key concepts in directly relevant , non technical terms. It covers the structure, shape and characteristics of a project, planning and evaluation, managing risk and change, managing stakeholders effectively with minimal time commitment, project delivery from concept to completion, and effective communications and information flow.",
