    "description": "Chemicals are an essential part of our life; but which ones are hazardous, when do they cause harm, what are the effects, and how can we safeguard our environment and health while balancing risks versus benefits? Finding scientifically sound answers to such questions is the mission of environmental toxicology; it combines elements of many scientific disciplines to assess and help manage the sources, fate and effects of chemicals on the environment and humans. This course offers an overview on some of the most important concepts and modern methods applied in this field, integrating basic and applied science throughout lectures, field sampling and laboratory work. The compulsory field trip is held in the mid-semester break and additional fees are payable.",
