    "description": "The course explores in a thematic and theoretically integrated manner common issues of loss and grief that are inherent in many aspects of human functioning and adverse life events. The influence of loss on reactions to a situation as well as approaches to intervention are considered. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to apply the knowledge gained to their personal experiences and work practices. They also learn how to present their assessments in the form of professional reports. The course aims to enhance the ability of practitioners to empower those dealing with loss through a) the encouragement of individual, familial, community and system strengths, and b) the prevention of the escalation of problems associated with failure to address issues of loss and grief incumbent in a particular situation.",
