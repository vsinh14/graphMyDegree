    "description": "This course provides an introductory understanding of the concepts and practices of group work and teamwork, and of ways in which planners can achieve effective outcomes in negotiating and community consultation for desirable planning and development outcomes, especially as part of a planning team. Because urban planners work mainly in teams it is critical that students are aware of the issues that can arise in working within groups, including the approaches that different people take to decision-making and problem solving. The course will include a basic standard personality assessment and will then build on students' team experiences to include basic approaches to conflict management, ethical negotiation, community consultation and group dynamics.",
