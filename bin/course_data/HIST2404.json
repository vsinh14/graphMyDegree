    "description": "This course explores the rise of Great Britain to global prominence from the mid-eighteenth century through key developments in British society and culture. Between 1780 and 1880, an economy in explosive growth fuelled new forms of wealth, dislocation and innovation. Modern problems of industry, political reform, social order and inequality, urban expansion and mass culture were faced for the first time. Using historical accounts and the work of writers and artists, we explore major themes such as the impact of industrialism, empire, social change and political unrest.",
