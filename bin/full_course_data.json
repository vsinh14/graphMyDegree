The course covers a number of applications so that the students become aware of actual problems that macroeconomists address prior to moving to the approaches taken. Topics covered includet he specification and estimation of the Phillips Curve; the specification and estimation of Reaction Functions; applications of VAR (e.g., NKPC) including identification by sign restrictions, long-run restrictions, and translating theory to the econometric specification; state space modelling including alternative approaches to estimation and inference;TVP-VARs applications and Specification and estimation of the Dynamic Stochastic Equilibrium Model (DSGE).",

The purpose of this comprehensive toolkit course is not only to provide students with a wide range of the necessary business analytical tools, but also to integrate these tools into a more complete and meaningful package that can be used as a portable toolkit for ensuing courses, and across their post-study career. To do this, this course follows a problem based approach, where an understanding of the decision-making frameworks is gained through its application to practical problems. Three themes per semester will be investigated in groups, using the multiple lenses that tools such as Business Model Canvas, Balanced Scorecards, Career Mapping, SOAR, PESTEL, Market Analysis, Porter's Five Forces, Financial Forecasting, Bell-Mason Diagnostic, Prior Art Searches, Scenario Planning, Technology Analysis, SWOT, Strategy Diamond, Seven Tools of Project Management, Business Plans, Root Cause Analysis, MInto Pyramid, and HR Audits provide. This will provide students with insights into both the nature of the business problems as well as methods that are used for identifying and evaluating alternative solutions.",

Are the geographic distributions of communities, higher order taxa, species, and alleles predictable by geography, environment, historical contingencies or interactions with other species, or inherent characteristics of species?\nMacroecology and biogeography are the study of spatial and temporal distributions of organisms, drawing upon the complementary disciplines of ecology and evolutionary biology. In this course, students will consider spatial patterns of biodiversity from global to local scales and considering both terrestrial and marine examples. Students will gain experience using approaches from comparative phylogenetics, community ecology, and landscape genetics to infer underlying causes of extant distributions and project future distributions in a changing world. Weekly learning activities will emphasize student participation, with discussions based on readings from the primary literature and problem solving using state-of-the-field computing.

The semester then involves independent reading and research, regular contact between student and supervisor, and the preparation of a 10,000 to 12,000-word report. This course can only be undertaken if the planned project is of immediate interest to a supervisor in one of the three Schools. Prospective students must themselves identify and approach a potential supervisor and discuss their proposed research question; supervisors are not assigned by the Program Director, however they can assist in facilitating potential supervisors, if necessary. \nThis is a restricted entry course and requires prior approval from the Program Director.

Unique attributes of 'millennial' and 'Z' generation young people will be used in conjunction with understandings of 'new times' as the basis for this thinking. The course provides understandings of the context specific professional and pedagogical issues which beginning teachers encounter in primary and middle schooling, and identifies specific contextual factors relevant to the contemporary educational environment. Importantly, this course facilitates the development of a personal philosophy of teaching. It also highlights the importance of collaborative team approaches to teaching and learning that are critical work practices for middle years educators in particular, and relatively new to the profession as a 'mainstream' approach to teacher preparation.\nArchived offerings\n\n\n\nCourse offerings\nLocation\nMode\nCourse Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSemester 1, 2010\t\n\nSt Lucia\nInternal\n\n\tCourse Profile\n\n\n\n\n",

With a strong emphasis on phenotypic microevolution, the course will cover the evolution of complex traits, such as life histories, morphology, complex behaviours and disease. The course centres around the study of two fundamental relationships; the genotype-phenotype map and the phenotype fitness map. We cover the predictive theories for evolution by natural selection and the measurement of evolvability and constraints. Approaches for genetic dissection of adaptive traits via Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) and Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) will be covered as well as their application to the testing of evolutionary processes. Example topics include the evolution of life histories (e.g. ageing) and trade-offs, adaptive radiations, pleiotropy and its consequences, mutation and the maintenance of\ngenetic variation. We use examples from non-model organisms and human disease. The human genetics component will be delivered by practising researchers from UQ's Diamantina Institute.",

The transplantation of those international norms into domestic law via the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (and key cases interpreting and applying those laws) will be carefully and critically analysed. Attention will also focus on the key challenges to refugee protection raised by contemporary Australian practices, especially in respect of asylum seekers arriving irregularly by sea; including mandatory detention, offshore (regional) processing and temporary protection. The course will encourage students to incorporate comparative and/or interdisciplinary perspectives into their legal analyses of international law and domestic law and practice.",

Whether as seats of monarchies and political power, seedbeds of subversion and revolution, or centres of trade and innovation and .culture, cities have punctuated human history - they might even be the greatest achievement of humankind. HIST3302 The City in History is a broad-ranging thematic course that seeks to explore the essence of urbanism and the urban experience through time via a wide set of case studies. Major cities from the ancient world to the present day are examined through developments in politics, social life, religion, urban reform and culture. We explore the urban spectacles of power, creativity, conflict and innovation from ancient Europe to Asia, the Americas and contemporary Australia. The course is thus concerned with the interconnections between urban places and human culture throughout recorded history. It suggests that the built fabric of cities is a material embodiment of historical developments in human society, economics, politics and culture. Particular cities and moments in time can be viewed as focal points to exemplify major patterns in human history.",

It is based on the idea that individuals, rather than states, should be the primary referent point for security and consequently that the provision of security for civilian populations is a responsibility of both the state and the international state system. This pivotal shift is not without tensions and problems, the most significant of which is that threats to the individual may be significantly different than threats to the state and may even encompass the state itself.At the same time, the human security concept remains exposed to academic and policy debates around whether threats should be narrowly (the freedom from fear agenda) or broadly (the freedom from want agenda) defined. Thus the course will focus on these divisions and on how human security changes the role that different actors and the international community play in conflict; examining how conflict affects individuals -- including civilians, refugees, and internally displaced persons -- and how humanitarian actors respond; as well as recent developments at the UN level including the protection of civilians agenda and the Responsibility to Protect doctrine on humanitarian intervention.",
