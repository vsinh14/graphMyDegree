Cultural approaches to death and burial in the archaeological record are explored, as well as the natural and artificial preservation of soft tissues (mummification). Site conditions that lead to bone preservation or break-down are also discussed.

Identification of minerals is thus a vital first step in understanding geological materials, their conditions of formation and subsequent history, and interpreting them in terms of tectonic and biological processes and economic importance. This course explores how to identify minerals by measuring their basic physical properties on hand specimens, and how to obtain much more detailed and precise information, mainly using polarised light in the petrological light microscope, but also the more advanced techniques of X-ray Diffraction and analytical Scanning Electron Microscopy. The physical and optical properties of minerals are largely determined by what chemical elements are present and how their atoms are arranged to form a crystal structure with a particular symmetry, so the earlier lectures and practicals cover the basics of how abundance of elements determines the compounds that occur as minerals, chemical bonding, crystal chemistry and crystallography. We then go on to survey the major rock-forming minerals, in the context of whether they are found mainly in igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary rocks, or in ores.",

        "description": "This course is designed to give students a working knowledge of how to correctly apply evolutionary biology to the study of human behaviour. Evolutionary psychologists use evolutionary biology to make inferences about psychological mechanisms. There are several ways of reconstructing humans' evolutionary past, leading to different sorts of psychological hypotheses. The course covers what psychologists can learn from game theory, hominid archaeology, primate behaviour, and hunter-gatherer cultures, giving an overview of the major sources of hypotheses in evolutionary psychology. Throughout, we will balance theory with critical review of empirical studies in evolutionary psychology.",
