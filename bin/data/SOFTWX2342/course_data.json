This course will cover in-depth knowledge for Cloud Computing and the practical experience in designing and implementing large-scale and composite business web applications on Cloud Computing platform. \n\nThis course covers a wide range of cloud computing-related X-as-a-Service technologies, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Data-as-a-Service (DaaS), and related technologies such as Cloud Computing Ecosystem. For delivering scalable computing services in a pay-as-you-go model via the Internet, Cloud Computing approaches are used to deal with effective and efficient development and deployment problems of web services and information systems with particular focus on \"big data\" challenges that arise across a variety of domains.",
