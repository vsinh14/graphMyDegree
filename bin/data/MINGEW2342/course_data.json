As part of the planning process a range of issues has to be considered including sustainability, statutory requirements and community expectations, mining method selection and mine layout, scheduling, equipment selection, cost estimation and economic evaluation, pre-feasibility studies and risk analysis. The course provides a step-by-step approach to developing a pre-feasibility study for a mining project.",
