Professional engineers working in both engineering design and manufacturing will deliver guest lectures into the course in order to locate key concepts within real world contexts. Students will engage in a number of Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing exercises including CNC machining of components. Students will also be introduced to the role of process simulation and modelling in manufacturing. The primary technical learning outcomes will be addressed through a combination of learning strategies including online resources, traditional lectures, and active learning CAD exercises.",
