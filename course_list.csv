In Australia possibly less than 10% have been described. Fungi exist as saprophytes, pathogens, endophytes and mutualistic symbionts. Along with algae they form lichens and with plants they form the all-important mycorrhizae, particularly essential for plants growing in nutrient depleted soils. Fungi cause 80% of plant diseases in agricultural crops, occasionally leading to crop failure where past incidences have led to humanitarian problems and other major social consequences. They are essential components in drug discovery and pharmaceutical production; most of the current antibiotics have been derived from fungal processes. Industrial uses such as the production of citric acid are dependent on fungal fermentation; the yeasts, essential components in alcohol fermentation and baking, are also fungi. However, as a Kingdom, a higher Kingdom within the Eukaryotes, fungi are often overlooked. This course aims to promote the Kingdom Fungi. You will learn about their classification using both traditional and molecular techniques. You will investigate the environments that you find fungi in and study the role that fungi play in those environments.

These choices concern issues such as what to consume, what to produce, how to produce it, how to organize production between different economic entities, and what prices to charge. Choices taken by individuals need to be coordinated to avoid wasted opportunities, the more so the more that specialization is taking place at the level of the individual, firm or national economy. A major coordinating role is played by price mechanisms, i.e. adjustments in relative prices and the incentives provided by profits and losses. However, much coordination is achieved via the use of planning and institutions. Even with coordination assisted by these devices coordination failures can still occur, such as major slumps in employment and international trade. Economic theory can help to assess when these problems are likely and how they may be dealt with."

Literate and numerate citizens contribute to the functioning of society and hence literacy and numeracy are a fundamental aspect of education. Literacy and numeracy practices are performed in a multitude of diverse contexts. The term `multiliteracies' acknowledges both the socially diverse (i.e., diverse languages, communication styles and socio-cultural contexts) and multimodal (i.e., any combination of these modes: oral, visual, audio, written, spatial, gestural, tactile) nature of literacy and numeracy practices in the twenty first century.

Research tells us that it is important to understand how various literacies and various cultural traditions combine these different modalities to make meanings that are more than the sum of what each could mean separately. National and international educational policy recognises both literacy and numeracy as essential foundational skills for success in all learning areas. Teaching strategies to build literacy and numeracy competence as general capabilities for personal enablement, civic and economic participation and social equity are the main focus of this course.

EIBS7304,Entrepreneurial Leadership,,,Quota: Minimum of 15 enrolments,,,2,,One Semester,"This course sits within the Social Sciences and Entrepreneurship Major within the Masters of Entrepreneurship and Innovation. As such the course responds to calls that, in order to handle increasing complexity, leaders of the 21st century require vertical as well as lateral development. Lateral development involves building knowledge and skills in a technical area, in this case Entrepreneurship. Vertical development though is about fundamental and transformative personal changes to worldviews. Such transformative change is the focus of consciousness studies in leadership development theory and research. The course is based on constructive-developmental stage models of leadership development which have extensive empirical support. These models indicate that most leadership development programs develop leaders to a 'conventional' stage of consciousness whereas contemporary global problems require transition to higher 'post-conventional' stages. Empirical research also indicates what the contents need to be to facilitate such a transition. Therefore, the course responds to calls in leadership literature for more post-conventional leaders. The course thus fulfils the mission of The University of Queensland to develop global leaders based on deep personal awareness. The course will utilize empirically supported theories and methodologies to take students on a personally transformative experience measured by their increasing ability to handle multidimensional complexity. Students will find this course a deep personal experience and must be prepared to undertake inner change and introspection. The course may draw on a range of techniques to accomplish this including meditative and metacognitive where they learn to more closely observe their constructed beliefs. The course should not be undertaken by students uninterested in personal development or the exploration of techniques which take them beyond their present stage of consciousness."

As Stephen Greenblatt surmises, it was a period in which the world took a 'swerve' towards the modern. The Europeans 'discovered' the new world of the Americas; merchants became global adventurers; new technologies emerged; belief faltered and secular culture developed. Knowledge itself was newly negotiated as a process of discovery in which the learner possessed new agency and responsibility, and in which the role of 'imagination' as we recognise it today was effectively transformed.
 
This course explores early modern British literature in these particular historical, cultural and intellectual contexts. It introduces students to works by key sixteenth- and seventeenth-century authors which may include Thomas More, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, John Donne, Andrew Marvel, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Francis Bacon, Margaret Cavendish, and Aphra Behn; and asks what part Literature played in the dynamic exchange between old and new worlds that underpins our swerve towards the modern."

Information extracted from images may be used in many ways, e.g., as a basis for mapping and monitoring changes to features (vegetation communities, land use type, soil types, mineral outcrops), biophysical properties (biomass of forest, crop yields, ozone concentration, soil moisture, building height) and for integration in geographic information systems (GIS) with other spatial data to support monitoring and management of natural and built environments.

Remote sensing is taught in a number of courses at the University of Queensland and GEOM2000/7000 is the fundamental course. GEOM3001/7001 provides more advanced image processing skills, while GEOS3400 presents a project based study in Biophysical Remote Sensing of a specific environment and GEOS3102 explains how remote sensing is used to measure global scale environmental changes. The skills learnt in remote sensing also form essential tools for use in higher level physical geography, ecology, human and physical geography, archaeology and earth science courses, including geomorphology, hydrology, climatology, oceanography and geophysics.

The content objective of the course is to understand: (1) how remotely sensed images are acquired; and (2) the biological, physical and chemical factors determining the appearance of natural and built environmental features in images.

Therefore, managers require risk assessment skills that allow them to accommodate multiple factors that affect risk and their relationship, account for uncertainty in risk factors, and evaluate risk management options. This requires skills in causal risk assessment whereby the relationships between risk factors are causally mapped, probabilities are applied to these causal relationships to develop a risk model and the risk model is used to evaluate risk management options.

Neither the market nor aid can solve global poverty and environmental problems; we need enterprise-led innovations that lead to positive change, and new collaborations that cross public, private and civil society divides. The private sector has long contributed to international development, through employment, contracting, foreign direct investment, and contributing to government revenues. Increasingly, the private sector is being encouraged to move beyond these conventional contributions and more actively contribute through innovative inclusive business models, including social entrepreneurship, `human-centred design', and blended-financing arrangements. More companies are now building and rebuilding their business models and brand around social good, which sets them apart from the competition and augments their success. These companies are searching for commercial and development synergies through 'shared value'. They are increasingly confident that profitable business can also sustainably alleviate social problems. Improving the private sector's development contribution involves understanding how and where core business, supply chain and business relationships have a development impact. We must also understand private sector's adverse impacts, so that businesses 'do no harm'. This course will prepare students to explore the potential of the private sector in different development 'contexts'; opportunities and barriers for enhancing the private sector's role in eradicating poverty; and innovative collaborations across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.

MOLI7101,Molecular Targets and Imaging Probes,,,,Science,Mathematics & Physics School,2,,One Semester,"This unit of study explores the characteristics of molecular targets and imaging probes that are required for successful molecular imaging experiments. A molecular target should: (i) detect a fundamental feature of a pathophysiological process, (ii) be validated by neuropathology, (iii) allow detection of disease early in its time course and (vi) lend itself to measurement with a biomarker that is reliable and minimally invasive. Once a molecular target for a particular disease is identified the methodology and requirements of a molecular probe suitable for imaging that target will be described. For example, in brain studies these include: (i) the imaging probe enters the brain in sufficient quantities, (ii) is stable in vivo, (iii) has moderate lipophilicity, (vi) exhibits low uptake of metabolites in brain, (v) is retained in the brain, (vi) displays high specificity and (vii) displays low non-specific binding.On completion of this unit of study, students should be able to identify molecular targets that may be useful in studying disease processes and have a clear understanding of the properties an imaging probe should possess to enable in vivo imaging of the molecular target of interest.

MOLI7104,Cell-labelling and tracking technologies in MR and molecular imaging,MRES7100 and the USyd course MRTY5109,,,Science,Mathematics & Physics School,2,,One Semester,"Molecular imaging in vivo has revolutionised the field of nanomedicine. Central to this technology is the ability to label, track and target specific cells in vivo. This is achieved by utilising the various molecular imaging modalities available to the clinician. In the pre-clinical sense, this includes computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), optical imaging (i.e. luminescence and fluorescence) and ultrasound. All of these modalities have specific advantages that can be translated into a suitable pre-clinical analysis (e.g. MRI provides exquisite spatial resolution while PET has extremely sensitive detection limits). These techniques can then be utilised to give different information regarding cell-labelling, tracking and targeting. The development of various cell labelling/targeting technologies can involve receptor binding motifs (e.g. antibodies, antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers, small molecules) that are directly attached to the imaging modality, or can be a part of a larger construct (e.g. nanomaterials). In this way, the various requirements for cell-labelling are incorporated into the one construct (e.g. receptor binding for uptake or attachment to cells, molecular imaging agent for tracking). This course will describe the various approaches used for cell-labelling in vivo, with particular emphasis on the complementary nature of each modality for application in nanomedicine."

We assume that students have no previous background in logic. It begins with some discussion as to what logic is and what its role in philosophy might be. It will then move on to more formal aspects. Beginning with the notion of a formal language into which sentences and arguments are to be translated, we shall develop the syntax and semantics for a language of sentences or propositions Â¿ classical propositional logic. Arguments can then be formalized and discussed with reference to the central notion of validity. The primitive language of classical propositional logic is then extended to accommodate the theory of quantifiers, which is formalisable in classical predicate logic, and the notion of validity is generalized to this extended language."

Please note: the course Levels are not interchangeable - if the course is completed as a Level 2 it cannot be credited as a Level 3.
The principal purpose of this course is to introduce students to the various theoretical approaches to the study of world politics. The subject matter of political theory - who gets what, when, where and how on a global scale - is open to a number of contrasting interpretations. The course therefore helps students critically engage with the ways in which ideas shape the practices of global politics. The course examines rival paradigms such as realism, liberalism, constructivism and feminism, as well as key concepts such as power, the international system, the state, anarchy, sovereignty, security, governance and norms."
POLS2209,Global Security,,GT263,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course examines security in international relations. We examine debates about the meaning of security in international relations and debates about the role, origins and changing nature of warfare in the international system. We then explore key global security dynamics ranging from the arms trade to nuclear proliferation, ethnic conflict and terrorism, and the contours of a new global security agenda in which we explore the relationship between security and poverty, disease and environmental change."
POLS2211,International Organisations & Political Cooperation,,GT279,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Examines cooperation by states in international relations, focusing on political, economic, security and human rights regimes evident in international organisations,especially the United Nations, the European Community, the OSCE, NATO, ASEAN and APEC."
POLS2217,European Political Issues,,GT207,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"POLS2217 introduces students to the personalities, institutions and dynamics that have shaped European politics since 1945. Primary areas of study include the European Union (EU), domestic and foreign politics of major European powers (eg Britain, France, Germany and Russia) and the impact of specific challenges facing these countries (eg the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of Communism, German re-unification, civil war in former Yugoslavia, the US-led war on terror) on the willingness of European states to cooperate. With its focus on cooperation in the EU, the course not only enhances the student's empirical knowledge of contemporary European politics, but also of theories seeking to explain why sovereign states cooperate."
POLS2222,Humanitarianism in World Politics,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Human security emerged in the 1990s as an alternative to the traditional state-based national security paradigm. It is based on the idea that individuals, rather than states, should be the primary referent point for security and consequently that the provision of security for civilian populations is a responsibility of both the state and the international state system. This pivotal shift is not without tensions and problems, the most significant of which is that threats to the individual may be significantly different than threats to the state and may even encompass the state itself.At the same time, the human security concept remains exposed to academic and policy debates around whether threats should be narrowly (the freedom from fear agenda) or broadly (the freedom from want agenda) defined. Thus the course will focus on these divisions and on how human security changes the role that different actors and the international community play in conflict; examining how conflict affects individuals -- including civilians, refugees, and internally displaced persons -- and how humanitarian actors respond; as well as recent developments at the UN level including the protection of civilians agenda and the Responsibility to Protect doctrine on humanitarian intervention."
POLS2223,Intelligence & National Security,,,,Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Intelligence is a subject of growing national and international importance. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, the role of intelligence in foreign and security policy has become more critical. Western governments (including Australia) have devoted considerable new resources to funding and reorganising intelligence agencies. This course will provide students with a deeper understanding of the role of intelligence in national security and will develop practical skills in aspects of intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination."
POLS2224,Culture and World Politics,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Cultural diversity is fundamental to the human condition, and an existential condition of world politics. But how should we understand cultural diversity, and how does it affect the play of politics globally? This course explores the complex and contested nature of culture, as well as the multiple axes of cultural diversity, and examines the effects of cultural identities, values, and practices on domestic and international politics. It begins by comparing constitutive, strategic, and institutional perspectives on culture, and then explores the following topics: culture and international order; religion in world politics; the `clashÂ¿ of civilisations; and ethnicity and nationalism. It concludes by examining the challenges of cultural diversity for the modern international order, focusing on questions of sovereign equality, international law, and human rights."
POLS2302,Political Thought: Machiavelli to Modernity,,GT223,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"The course examines the history of political thought in western Europe, from Machiavelli to Marx.

Discussion of major critiques of critical theory, including feminist and post-modern critiques."
POLS2309,Politics & Art,,,,,,2,,One Semester,"This course starts from the assumption once expressed by Albert Einstein, that ""imagination is more important than knowledge"". We study artistic sources, such as poetry, visual art, film, and music to gain new perspectives on key political issues, such as war, terrorism and poverty. The course introduces key debates in aesthetics and then moves on to apply them in practice through various alternative teaching tools, such as situational exercises and interactive learning."
POLS2310,Politics in Literature & Film,,GO238,,Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Explores political concepts - power, justice, citizenship, political identity, conquest, oppression, domination - through significant works of literary fiction and film, complemented by relevant social science readings.
* As five films will be viewed in the course, five lectures will run to 3 hours to cover this."
POLS2401,Politics & the Economy,,GT261,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"The course examines the economic importance of politics in Australia and elsewhere. Literature on the institutional determinants of economic performance will be presented in the context of the key institutions of economic policy advice and key economic policy debates. Students will be provided with an empirical background that will allow evaluation of conflicts over economic management and industrial restructuring and 'new' forms of decision making, as well as associated conceptual controversies in political economy and state theory."
POLS2402,Globalisation & International Political Economy,,GO228,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,This course examines the political aspects of economic globalization. It introduces students to a classical and contemporary theoretical perspectives on international political economy. The course treats globalizing tendencies as distinct phenomena in their own right and as an influence on domestic public policies in individual nations. Key issues include the conflict between forces seeking to facilitate globalization and those seeking to resist it. The course allows students to draw connections between the School's offerings in international relations and in political economy.
POLS2404,The Political Dynamics of Development and Resistance,,GT241,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course focuses on the politics of global development processes. It examines the contemporary development constellation and explores the way in which local and global contexts are increasingly interconnected in an era of globalisation. We investigate the diverse actors involved in the development process, from local groups through NGOs, national development agencies, private actors, and multilateral institutions (such as the IMF and the World Bank), and consider the political implications of their interactions. The course traces the relevance of historical legacies and considers their implications for the changing political contexts of development in the 21st century. We examine regional experiences of development, as well as the way in which development in an era of globalisation is transforming national development experiences. The final part of the course is dedicated to examining contemporary development and poverty reduction approaches, such as the Millennium Development Goals and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper initiatives."
POLS2409,International Relations of the Twentieth Century,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course examines the evolution of international relations from 1900 to the present, and is intended to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the key developments that have shaped world politics and the discipline of international relations. This course is particularly targeted at students of international relations (IR), and provide those students with knowledge about the evolution of IR as a discipline, a sense of the relationship between IR theory and the major dynamics/ events of world politics, and provide context to the examination of contemporary world politics. Each week of the course, therefore, attempts to link key developments in world politics to the emergence/dominance of particular frameworks for thinking about international relations."
POLS2503,Conflict & Nonviolent Change,,"EX203, VX201, GT256",,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course explores the philosophical underpinnings and practical application of nonviolence as a means for effecting social change. Making extensive use of case studies and primary sources, we study the relationship between violence and nonviolence in particular historical contexts, as well as examining debates over the ethics and efficacy of resistance. By focusing on nonviolence, as well as its ostensible opposite, we gain insight into the character of social relations and the distinct forms of violence and nonviolence which mark the everyday lived experiences of people across the world. Such insights allow us to think anew about the nature of contemporary conflicts and resistance movements, including, for example, consideration of the role of new technologies and social media in the pursuit of social change."
POLS2511,The Politics of Peacebuilding,,POLS3511,,Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"From 2011, this course is offered as POLS3511."
POLS2515,Theories of Peace and Conflict Studies,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Peace and Conflict Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study with a commitment to the non-violent management and resolution of conflict from the local to the international level. To pursue this goal, core political concepts such as power, order, violence and justice are theorized in distinctive ways. This course develops an understanding of key theoretical approaches in peace and conflict studies research, and enables students to understand the relevance of theory to practice in this field. Students will engage in critical dialogue on questions such as how we identify actors in peace and in conflict, and how we can work against differing forms of violence and reconstitute just and participatory social and political order in the wake of violence."
POLS2603,Gender and Global Politics,,GT281,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course explores the relevance of gender to the study of global politics. We approach gender as a complex and contested social construction that intersects with other axes of social identity to influence the way that we experience and understand the world. We examine how gender shapes and is shaped by the discourses, structures, and institutions of global politics, including those of development, health, the economy, human rights, war, peace, and colonialism. The course is designed to impart skills in gender analysis and to develop student capacity for independent research, critical thinking, and ethical reflexivity."
POLS2703,Principles of Research: Social and Comparative Perspectives,,"GT271, POLS3703",,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course addresses controversies over the principles and practice of social science research. It provides an overview of contrasting approaches to research in the social sciences, the foundations that underpin them and contestations over their claims to knowledge and truth. Trends in social research are reviewed with particular focus on debates over the design and value of cross-national and cross-cultural research and the potential to inform evidence-based policy. The overall aims are to sensitise students to the contested nature of social research and to produce critical consumers with the skills necessary for interpreting claims from social science."
POLS2805,Advanced Topics in Political Science,#6 POLS,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Semester 2 2016 - Regulating Warfare: Ethics, Law, and Politics.
Why, how, and on which principles do we seek to regulate warfare? Isn't the very idea of regulating armed conflict contradictory since it requires co-operation between parties unable to avoid resort to violence in the first place? The theme of this course is that regulating of warfare represents the rich meeting ground between ethical, legal, and political principles and we need to explore how these interact with each other.
Advanced topics in political science, not covered in other courses, and available only under special circumstances (for example, course to be given by a visiting lecturer in a specialty area that is not usually available). Regardless of changes in the content of the course, students can only take the course once. Please contact the Senior Administrative Officer (Academic) in the School of Political Science and International Studies for information on the current topic."
POLS3102,Governance & Australian Public Policy,,"GT231, POLS2102",,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course is structured around four debates which characterize the study of governance and public policy. The first is the government to governance debate. Are we now in an era of governance in which state power and traditional modes of government have been hollowed out? The second debate is between representative democracy and more participative forms of policymaking. In the face of declining trust and support for traditional representative institutions, should we be searching for answers in mechanisms which include citizens more often in policymaking? The third debate is between structure and agency. How can we square this circle theoretically so that we might explain governance and policymaking with respect to both? Finally, rational versus post-rational knowledge. What types of knowledge and ways of knowing are best for the formulation and implementation of policy? As we weave through these debates we rely on a range of policy examples (environmental policy, water management, indigenous policy, disaster management) and invite policy practitioners from government into our class to discuss their experiences."
POLS3103,Issues in Australian Politics,,"GT205, POLS2103",,Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"POLS3103 presents a topical introduction to contemporary political issues and debates in Australia. It concerns our understanding of some of the major political, social and economic issues that confront Australian society and Australian political decision-makers, and how policies are framed by these understandings.
The course also reviews the significant changes that characterise the key institutions of political decision-making and the ideologies that have influenced these changes. It examines the opportunities and costs that these changes present for democratic political development and the ideologies that have influenced these changes."
POLS3115,Environmental Politics & Policy,,"GO211, POLS2115",,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course was previously offered as the Level 2 POLS2115. Please note: the course Levels are not interchangeable - if the course is completed as a Level 2 it cannot be credited as a Level 3.
This course explores contemporary challenges in environmental politics and policy, and probes responses to these, using a range of methods and approaches. We will work collaboratively on developing in-depth analyses of prominent contemporary concerns, from climate change through biodiversity issues to contestations over extractive industries, and questions of sustainable development. The course will be run in the format of weekly two-hour workshops, comprising short introductory `mini-lecturesÂ¿ (15-20 minutes), in-class research sessions, task-based group work, and plenary conclusions. Our focus is on combining advanced learning about cutting-edge theories and methods in political analysis with producing substantive analyses of policy and political problems and challenges based on extensively researched case-examples. The latter will cover local, national, international, and transnational instances.
Please note that this course, due to its adopted format, will not have lectures recorded and requires a commitment to attending weekly classes."
POLS3118,Advances in Political Psychology,,POLS2118,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Why do some disenfranchised groups engage in collective action, while others accept their inferior position? How could an authoritarian leader like Hitler acquire such a massive following? Why do some leaders become regarded as charismatic, while others are dismissed as uninspiring? Why are some people attracted to the political left, while others are drawn to the right? What can policy-makers do to secure lasting attitude- and behaviour change? These, and many other questions, are the province of political psychology, a field that uses qualitative and quantitative methods and psychological theories as tools to help understand political processes. In this advanced-level course, students are familiarized with the most prominent debates in political psychology, as well as with more contemporary perspectives that problematize the many assumptions about human behaviour and motivation underlying these classic perspectives."
POLS3203,Power and Order in Transnational Politics,,"GO225, POLS1203",,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"How is change possible in the international system? How do actors bring it about, and which actors matter? 'Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their own circumstances and fate'. Such a view is substantially different than that espoused by the realist school, which focuses primarily on the material capabilities of states. While the state is the primary actor in international relations, today its power is challenged along a number of directions: whether by changes at the domestic level; by international actors such as international and non-governmental organizations and transnational actors; by events outside its control, whether globalization, conflict, or state failure; and finally by the very structures of international society. This course will use the role of the state in the international system today to explore issues of agency, the emergence of new forms of global governance, and the rise of new transnational threats and problems"
POLS3206,Policy Challenges of Asia-Pacific Security,,POLS2206,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"The course considers the main security challenges in the Asia-Pacific - military & non-traditional - focusing on major debates over policy responses to them. The Asia-Pacific is the world's most economically dynamic region. It is also one of the world's worst hot-spots for a host of security problems: the rise of China is challenging American primacy in the Asia-Pacific, a key fixture since the end of World War II; on the Korean Peninsula, the threat of nuclear war is very real; and the region's rapacious and rapid economic development has generated or exacerbated a wide range of non-traditional security problems, such as pandemics, climate change and environmental degradation. This course considers the main security challenges in the Asia-Pacific - both military and non-traditional - focusing on major debates over policy responses to them. It seeks to equip students with the capacities to analyse security problems in the region and provide relevant policy advice."

POLS3511,The Politics of Peacebuilding,,POLS2511,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"There is a great deal of writing about war, violence, and trauma but often little about how such issues are addressed in post-conflict situations. Peacebuilding brings together the theory and practice of conflict resolution, humanitarian intervention, human rights and development. The development of peacebuilding is becoming one of the most pressing contemporary international issues as the world seeks answers to entrenched civil war conflict. Peacebuilding challenges confront organisations from the United Nations to international non-government organisations and states from Afghanistan to Australia. In this course we develop an understanding of contemporary theories of peacebuilding and critically engage with peacebuilding at both a theoretical and practical level."
POLS3512,"Global Media, War and Peace",,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course explores the origins and contemporary roles of media in international affairs, both as a source of information and, increasingly, as an important medium of war, peace, and diplomacy. The course is composed of three tracks. The first is foundational, focusing on the dual development of colonial and media empires from early days of the panorama, photography, print media, radio, TV, global news corporations, to todayÂ¿s Internet (web 2.0) - thus covering the origins of and evolution from old to digital new media. The second is theoretical, using classical International Relations and critical theory to examine media as product and instrument of cultural, economic and political struggles. The third is practical, using second weekly 'Global Media Workshops' in which guest media practitioners (from war reporters, film documentary makers, bloggers, to social media activists) teamed with International Relations theorists will present classes in a variety of media, including print, photography, radio, cinema, television, and online convergences. Combining history, theory, critical viewing, and film screenings, and based on a retrospective study of news media, documentaries, and critical media theory, the course will map the complex contemporary global media environment where the satellite, Internet and cell phone, among other recent technologies, have created a new political panorama of messages, meanings and stratagems directly affecting international politics and questions of war and peace."

POLS7000,Writing Politics,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,4,,One Semester,"This course aims to provide students with foundational knowledge and skills relevant to the study of politics across the areas of Governance and Public Policy, Peace and Conflict Studies and International Relations. Before one can write well in politics, one must be able to read well. Thus, the course begins with consideration of the importance of critically reading texts in order to recognize both argument and underlying assumptions. Doing so requires acknowledgment of the open-ended or essentially contested nature of many of the concepts that are used in political discourse and analysis. Such recognition equips us to be informed readers and therefore more skilful analysts and writers in our chosen field.

Suitable for international students and other students with a limited knowledge of Australian politics."
POLS7101,Dynamics of Governance,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course deals with the practices of modern governance. Governance can be defined as the tools, strategies and relationships used by governments to help govern. Interest in governance has in part been spurred by the view that governments should experiment more with `non-governmental' mechanisms in dealing with pressing problems, for example, through the use of market mechanisms, or by forging collaborative or partnership relationships with civil society or community organisations. A central argument in this course, however, is that the role of governments and state agencies remains central to governance strategies, and that governments have an important responsibility to oversee, steer, resource and render accountable all forms of governance. This notion of the `government of governance' can be termed `metagovernance'. 

The course also deals with questions of knowledge and rationality in policy and governance systems and about how ideas and discourses shape the world of policy and governance. The course also explores the impact of power and institutional arrangements in shaping governance practices."

POLS7112,Overview of Policy Knowledge,,POLS2120,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course provides postgraduate students with an introduction to the core forms of knowledge that shape public policies. At a theoretical level students engage in an exploration of the most important epistemologies that affect public policymaking. Students are also introduced to key debates about policy and politics: how do rational models of policy knowledge enhance and undermine aspects of the policy process? How can scientific data be factored into policymaking and how does it affect democratic decision making? Is there a non-rational knowledge, which respects individuals, emotions, and fallibility, in public policy? And how might indigenous knowledge be used to improve policy outcomes? At a more pragmatic level students are also introduced to the principles and methods of policy analysis and evidence-based learning. Here students will be taught the ways in which the efficacy of public policy can be assessed and improved. Consequentially, those who take this course will be given an introduction to the key aspects of policy knowledge and the debates that surround them."
POLS7113,Comparative Public Policy,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course examines the strengths and limitations of a comparative approach to the analysis of public policies.

POLS7114,Knowledge and Evidence in Public Policy,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course frames public policy as a cognitive and ideational process where actors/agents use ideas and mental schemas to understand and influence the policy world. In doing so, it contrasts data-driven ""rational"" decision making models with ""post-positivist"" approaches to decision making based on narratives and interpretive schemas. The course begins with an introduction to the theory and conceptual tools for understanding knowledge and evidence in the public policy process. We ask what is `usefulÂ¿ or `appropriateÂ¿ knowledge for various actors? And what does it mean to be debating, negotiating and `muddling throughÂ¿? We move on to explore the problems of conventional policy analysis in a complex world. We then apply these conceptual and theoretical tools to better understand how policy knowledges operate in practical situations. This is done through consideration of case studies drawn from such areas as health, welfare, and law and order (in Australia and elsewhere). The final part of the course takes a more `practicalÂ¿ look at the actual uses of knowledge and evidence in public policy cases, with the assistance of `practitionersÂ¿. We will invite guest lectures from senior policy practitioners to outline examples of the applied use of knowledge and evidence in various aspects of policy processes: advice; design; making; implementation; review; evaluation and audit."

POLS7225,Foreign Policy and Diplomacy,,,Minimum of 10 enrolments,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course examines foreign policy and practices of diplomacy in international relations. We first examine theories of foreign policy before exploring the process of foreign policy formation, the role of different sets of actors in influencing foreign policy, key practices or sites of diplomacy and the role of ethical considerations in foreign policy. In the latter half of the course we apply these insights to a series of foreign policy case studies, and conclude with a simulation exercise associated with a hypothetical `global incident'."
POLS7226,New Security Challenges,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course will track the evolution of warfare including the phenomenon of Â¿new warsÂ¿ and examine a number of contemporary issues in security. The relationship between the environment and security, and the difference gender makes to international security are investigated through case study and participant led examples."
POLS7227,Critical Security Studies,POLS7251,,,,,2,,One Semester,"This course is concerned with the development of critical approaches to the study and practice of security in International Relations. It encourages students to reflect on the analytical and ethical assumptions that shape security conceptions and practices in contemporary global politics. After locating debates about the meaning of security in historical context, it explores different theoretical approaches to security from a range of critical perspectives (from Critical Theory to securitization, post-structuralism, feminist approaches and post-colonialism). These insights are then examined in a series of empirical case studies, from warfare to WMD proliferation, climate change, poverty and terrorism (See proposed learning activities at the bottom of this document)"
POLS7228,Strategic Studies,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course examines the nature, uses and limits of military power as an instrument of political influence in contemporary world politics. Part one of the course introduces students to conceptual debates on the role of military power in the world today. In particular, we focus on debates concerning the supposed transformation of both 'security' and war, and the implications of these debates for the management of violence in the international system. Part two of the course then examines the role of military power, relative to other instruments of statecraft, in shaping international relations between states. We focus here especially on themes of Great Power rivalry, alliances and collective security regimes, nuclear weapons proliferation, and energy security. In part three of the course, we then examine the uses and limits of military power as a means of managing 'new' security challenges, focusing particularly on transnational terrorism and asymmetric conflicts. In part four , we conclude with an extensive reflection of the future of war and military power in world politics."
POLS7229,"Global Governance: Origins, Challenges and Trajectories",,,Minimum of 10 enrolments,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"The increasing integration of the world driven by globalisation has created a growing number of issues that can no longer be dealt with at the national level by states alone. Issues such as climate change, weapons control or the regulation of the global economy can only be addressed globally, facilitating the emergence of a global governance structure intended to manage this globalised world order. This course explores this structure, its origins, its formal and informal actors and its processes. First, we examine the key theoretical frameworks in the field, including the realist, liberal and critical conceptions of global governance. Second, we explore the historical evolution of global governance since World War II, including the emergence of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods System, its crises, and the `New World Order of the post-Cold War period. We also explore the rationale for the formation of the European Community (now the EU) and its functions, regionally and globally. Finally, the course analyses some of the key contemporary issues facing global governance. The course concludes by reflecting on the future of global governance in an increasingly multipolar world."

POLS7232,Humanitarian Emergencies,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"The principal purpose of this course is to introduce researchers and practitioners to the decision-making and governance processes embedded in responses to humanitarian emergencies, illustrative of mass atrocity crimes, large-scale conflict, or environmental disasters. The course therefore equips graduates with a holistic understanding of the complexities of humanitarian emergencies, and respective responses, they will face in their future careers. The course uses the case-study method to examine different humanitarian emergencies with unlike causal pathways, varying timelines, but high levels of lethality to critically engage with the decision-making and governance complexities that influence responses to crises such as genocide, war, and natural disasters."
POLS7251,Theories in International Relations,,POLS7250,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course is designed to interrogate the theoretical underpinnings of practices of explanation and understanding in International Relations (IR), and to provide learners with the means to formulate and use theories and theorems in their own investigations at an advanced level. We take a problem-driven approach to investigate, evaluate and reconstruct different theoretical approaches, and to unpacking their respective limits and potentials. Our focus is hence on `theories as practicesÂ¿, as significant elements for building compelling political analyses."
POLS7253,Power and Order in Transnational Politics,,POLS3203,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course provides postgraduate students with no prior background in international relations or peace and conflict studies a necessary theoretical grounding in the subject. The course will use the role of the state in the international system today to explore issues of agency, the emergence of new forms of global governance, and the rise of new transnational threats and problems."
POLS7258,Foundations in International Relations,,POLS1201,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course aims to provide postgraduate students with no prior background in International Relations or Peace and Conflict Studies a necessary grounding in the subject.

POLS7260,Politics of International Law,,,Minimum of 10 enrolments,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"Politics and law are inextricably related. This is evident in the establishment and evolution of various international laws, in the constraining effect that international laws have on states' behaviour, and in terms of codifying what is expected from governments and their citizens as duties towards the international community. International relations are increasingly being shaped by the growth of legal norms across a range of issue-areas: human rights protection, environmental concerns, weapons control, the use of force and the legitimacy of military action all come to mind as cases where the United Nations and other law-making bodies are shaping the world in which we live. There nevertheless is a tension between the establishment of global norms and the sovereign nature of independent states, where the latter may choose to contest or even disregard widely-accepted norms of behaviour. The course will cover these issues and use case related material to explore the politics of interantional law."
POLS7302,Politics of Development,,,Minimum of 10 enrolments,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course focuses on the centrality of politics in development.

The course introduces and engages competing approaches to development, and considers the politics and political implications of everyday lived experiences of development policy. Throughout the course, we closely examine the politics of social change, and consider the legacies of historical political change and their implications for contemporary development processes and challenges."
POLS7306,International Crisis Management,,,Minimum of 10 enrolments,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"This course provides students with an understanding of the policies and practices of crisis governance and the dynamics of post-crisis institutional reform, and emphasizes the participatory solutions which are now being proposed within this governance agenda. The course locates contemporary crises within an international development context, and, within this context, explores crisis causation, state-led crisis responses, and consequential reform efforts through governance, policy-analysis, and (participatory) democratic perspectives."
POLS7311,Diplomacy and Development,,,,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,This course will illustrate the changing context of diplomacy and development. Questions of power and inequality will be a key component as well the emergence of complex multilateralism. Issues covered will include the role of representation in diplomacy and development and how images shape humanitarian responses.
POLS7325,Security and Development,,,Minimum of 10 enrolments,Humanities and Social Sciences,Politic Sc & Internat Studies,2,,One Semester,"It has long been recognized that security and development are intricately linked. There are competing approaches to the relationship between security and development, which in turn are contingent upon how security and development are conceptualized. In this course, we familiarize ourselves with new conceptual and methodological approaches aimed at understanding and explaining not only the co-constitution of development and security, but also contexts in which development creates insecurities, or in which security policy has adverse implications for development aspirations. Through investigating case examples from both, historical and contemporary contexts and settings, we critically examine the many connections and tensions between development and security. Among the topics we cover are `fragile states', human security, conflict minerals, privatization of security (the `security-industrial complex') and development contractors, resistance to security/development policies, colonial legacies and continuities, and `zapatismo'.
After completing this course you will be able to analyze complex situations in which experiences of (in)security are conditioned by, or condition development aspirations or practices. You will also be in a position to work towards achieving development and security in more just and sustainable ways."

It investigates the challenges and questions generated through the interaction and enmeshment of top-down institutional approaches to peacebuilding with bottom-up informal modes of peace formation and governance in the local context. It explores the international/local and state/non-state interactions in peacebuilding, focusing on the notion of hybridity and concepts like 'hybrid forms of peace' and 'hybrid political orders'. 

The course begins by unpacking the conceptual framework and explores the theoretical arguments around statebuilding, hybrid political orders, hybrid peace and what is referred to as the `local turn'. In doing so we explore legal pluralism and hybrid approaches to policing and security. We then critically engage with these concepts - challenging the normative implications and considering the shortfalls of these arguments. Once the key concepts are bedded down we take a close look at what the `local' and hybridity means in practice through a series of guest lectures covering a range of case studies. Guest lecturers share stories as practitioners and field researchers from Indonesia, China, Indigenous Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and Pacific Island Countries."

resistant presentations may include any psychiatric disorder that does not respond to standard treatment.
Treatment resistance is more than complexity created by comorbid diagnostic issues and typically patientÂ¿s
present with a significant history of failure to respond to intervention or a modest time limited response with
relapse. Importantly personality disorder is often part of the clinical presentation in treatment resistant
cases. Personality disorder has an established role in treatment resistance and requires specialised treatment
approaches. Typically, psychotherapeutic approaches to working with treatment resistance are based on
those developed for working with personality disorder. Specialised psychotherapeutic approaches are
required by this patient group to assist them to improve their level of functioning. The course will focus on

This course provides students with an introduction to the fundamentals of structural equations with latent variables. Latent variable structural equation modelling (SEM) is a very general and flexible modelling framework with much application to research in the applied business disciplines (e.g., accounting, business information systems, international business, management, marketing, etc.). SEM subsumes many statistical models as special cases (e.g., factor analysis and linear regression) and is especially designed to incorporate latent variables, which in typical applications represent attitudes or other latent Â¿constructs.Â¿ This course focuses on the fundamental theory of latent variable SEM and is not particularly mathematical.

Quota: Minimum of 10 enrolments","Business, Economics & Law",Business School,2,,One Semester,"Research in business is characterised by an increasing sophistication in methods and models. Recent advances in probability and statistics have paved the way for analytical methods that are effective in explaining business behaviour, and are also easy to implement. This course provides students with an in-depth introduction to such modelling approaches, and examines several different types of data that are not easily approximated using the normal distribution. These models will be examined side by side with formal theory building, being useful to building modelling applications in diverse areas of business (eg. finance, marketing, etc). The course will involve a considerable amount of experience based learning. Students will take a hands-on approach to learn the concepts at a fundamental level, and be applying them to real problems. By building models from scratch students will get ""under the bonnet"" in understanding advanced data analysis. This will prepare students to handle customised applications for dealing with many different types of data, and give students a deeper insight into how statistical analysis works together with theoretical modelling."

As such the course responds to calls that, in order to handle increasing complexity, leaders of the 21st century require vertical as well as lateral development. Lateral development involves building knowledge and skills in a technical area, in this case Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Vertical development though is about fundamental and transformative personal changes to worldviews. Such transformative change is the focus of consciousness studies in leadership development theory and research. Research indicates that leaders develop their consciousness in stages with higher stages able to handle higher levels of complexity. These stages can include the leader shifting their central basis of operation in the world from egocentric to ethnocentric to worldcentric perspectives. The course thus fulfils the mission of the University of Queensland to develop global leaders based on deep personal awareness. The course will utilize empirically supported theories and methodologies to take students on a personally transformative experience measured by their increasing ability to handle multidimensional complexity.

TIMS7301,Principles of Entrepreneurship,,MEBS7116 or TIMS3302,Quota: Minimum of 15 enrolments,"Business, Economics & Law",Business School,2,,One Semester,"Entrepreneurship is commonly regarded as the pursuit of opportunity beyond the resources apparently to hand. With this maxim in mind, we explore the theory and practice of starting then growing new ventures, where opportunities exist but the pathways to unleash promising outcomes are uncertain.

Topics include the process of entrepreneurial logic, designing business models for value capture and delivery, framing competitive strategy, determining assumptions-based finance needs, understanding different innovation types and managing growth to build stronger ventures."
TIMS7302,The Business of Complex Projects,,,Quota: Minimum of 15 enrolments,,,2,,One Semester,"This course focuses on the business of complex projects. It is not a traditional course about the art and science of project management. Rather, we focus on understanding the unique managerial and strategic challenges associated with leading project-based organisations. These are an increasingly important type of organisation. Projects account for over 20% of global economic activity and project-based organisations are at the heart of this phenomenon. These are a species of organisation for which survival and prosperity rest on the continuous execution of complex projects. Industries where these organisations are prevalent range from architecture and design (e.g. Arup), construction (e.g. Laing O'Rouke), and mining (e.g. Thiess), through to consulting (e.g. E&Y), video games (e.g. Valve) and feature films (e.g. Fox). The nature of work within these organisations differs significantly to those not organised around projects (Davies and Hobday, 2005). For example, the organisation's core capabilities are embedded in project teams that are often located in the field (""off-site""), have limited contact with each other or head quarters, and have to work in project delivery teams with people from complementary organisations. The management of project-based organisations has, as a result, often required a different focus to that seen in the traditional business firm. This is particularly the case when one looks at how best to create and execute strategy, develop and grow capabilities, govern the organisation, and generate innovation. This course will draw strongly on my own research and experience to take you inside this world, help you understand it, and provide you with new analytical tools that will help you understand, operate within, and manage project-based organisations."
