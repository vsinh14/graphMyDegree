Common and emerging manufacturing processes will be introduced. Professional engineers working in both engineering design and manufacturing will deliver guest lectures into the course in order to locate key concepts within real world contexts. Students will engage in a number of Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing exercises including CNC machining of components.
