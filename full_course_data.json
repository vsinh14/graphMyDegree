They also need to know what actions will minimise risk or reduce it to an acceptable level. Many factors affect risk and many risk factors are not easily quantifiable. Therefore, managers require risk assessment skills that allow them to accommodate multiple factors that affect risk and their relationship, account for uncertainty in risk factors, and evaluate risk management options. This requires skills in causal risk assessment whereby the relationships between risk factors are causally mapped, probabilities are applied to these causal relationships to develop a risk model and the risk model is used to evaluate risk management options. This course equips students with these skills.",

It explores the international/local and state/non-state interactions in peacebuilding, focusing on the notion of hybridity and concepts like 'hybrid forms of peace' and 'hybrid political orders'. \n\nThe course begins by unpacking the conceptual framework and explores the theoretical arguments around statebuilding, hybrid political orders, hybrid peace and what is referred to as the `local turn'. In doing so we explore legal pluralism and hybrid approaches to policing and security. We then critically engage with these concepts - challenging the normative implications and considering the shortfalls of these arguments. Once the key concepts are bedded down we take a close look at what the `local' and hybridity means in practice through a series of guest lectures covering a range of case studies. Guest lecturers share stories as practitioners and field researchers from Indonesia, China, Indigenous Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and Pacific Island Countries.",
